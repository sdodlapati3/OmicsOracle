        "abstract": "The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection mostly represented by asymptomatic or mild, however a small but relevant proportion of patients develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by an excessive, host immune response with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can rapidly lead to multi-organ failure and death. Indeed, immune pathologies are well characterised through deep immune phenotyping, plasma analysis, sc-RNA and chip based methylation analysis, still we lack a molecular understanding of immune pathologies associated with COVID-19 which is urgently needed for new prognostic and therapeutic interventions. In this study, we first time showed a SARS-Cov2 induced severity associated deregulation of immune functions driven through a global reprogramming of immune functions through a epigenetically driven gene regulatory network",

This data is valuable for research as it provides insights into the immune response alterations associated with severe COVID-19, which could inform the development of prognostic markers and therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the hyper-inflammatory responses characteristic of severe cases.",

        "abstract": "Fatal COVID-19 is often complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanisms governing lung injury and repair in ARDS remain poorly understood because there are no biomarker-targeted therapeutics for patients with ARDS. We hypothesized that plasma proteomics may uncover unique biomarkers that correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 ARDS. We analyzed the circulating plasma proteome from 32 patients with ARDS and COVID-19 using an aptamer-based platform, which measures 7289 proteins, and correlated protein measurements with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores at 2 time points (Days 1 and 7 following ICU admission). We compared differential protein abundance and SOFA scores at each individual time point and identified 119 proteins at Day 1 and 46 proteins at Day 7 that correlated with patient SOFA scores. We modeled the relationship between dynamic protein abundance and changes in SOFA score between Days 1 and 7 and identified 39 proteins that significantly correlated with changes in SOFA score. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified increased ephrin signaling and acute phase response signaling correlated with increased SOFA scores over time, while pathways related to pulmonary fibrosis signaling and wound healing had an inverse relationship with SOFA scores between Days 1 and 7. These findings suggest that persistent inflammation may drive worsened disease severity, while repair processes correlate with improvements in organ dysfunction over time. This approach is generalizable to more diverse ARDS cohorts for identification of protein biomarkers and disease mechanisms as we strive towards targeted therapies in ARDS.",
