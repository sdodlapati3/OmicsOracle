        "abstract": "The use of single-cell RNA sequencing in clinical and translational research is limited by cross-species differences and the challenge of identifying cell-type-specific, targetable molecular changes in individual patients. Here, we created an Integrated Single-cell Kidney Atlas including over one million cells from 140 samples, defining more than 70 conserved cell states in human and rodent models. We developed CellSpectra, a computational tool that quantifies changes in gene expression coordination across cellular functions, which we applied to kidney and lung cancer data. This tool powers our Patient-Level Single-Cell Functional Profiling Report, which highlights cell-type-specific changes in pathway gene expression coordination in individuals. Our cross-species atlas facilitates the selection of a rodent model that closely reflects the cellular and pathway-level signatures observed in a patient sample, advancing the application of single-cell methodologies in clinical precision medicine. Finally, by using experimental models, we demonstrate how our informatics approach can be applied for the potential selection of suitable therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy offers limited benefit in advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). This study explores the potential of combining MET pathway inhibition with chemo-immunotherapy for treating advanced SCLC. MET pathway activation triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition, fostering chemoresistance and potentially undermining the efficacy of immunotherapy. In a SCLC mouse model, MET inhibition added to chemo-immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1) reduced tumor growth and extended survival by reshaping the tumor microenvironment, decreasing suppressive myeloid cells, and promoting an effective immune response. Analysis of patient samples revealed that myeloid-enriched immune infiltrates during chemo-immunotherapy might contribute to treatment resistance. Notably, elevated serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels were associated with a mesenchymal and inflamed phenotype, indicating that this subgroup of patients could potentially benefit from MET inhibitor (METi)-based therapeutic strategies.",

        "title": "SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2 recruits GIGYF2 near viral replication sites and supports viral protein production [nsp2_del_rna_seq]",
        "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps), with Nsp2 being the least conserved and least understood. In this study, we found a crucial role of Nsp2 in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and demonstrated its interaction with GIGYF2, which causes the relocation of GIGYF2 to near double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and the enhancement of viral protein production. Deletion of the Nsp2-coding region from the viral genome led to a drastic reduction in viral RNA synthesis early in infection (3\u20134 hours post infection). Through interactome analysis of Nsp2 in virus-infected cells, we identified GIGYF2\u2014a protein involved in translational regulation\u2014as a key partner of Nsp2. We confirm the interaction between GIGYF2 and Nsp2 from both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Depleting GIGYF2 or its cofactor ZNF598 phenocopied the replication defects observed with Nsp2 deletion, suggesting their critical roles in viral reproduction. Moreover, GIGYF2 and ZNF598 relocate to areas near DMVs, viral replication sites, upon infection. This relocation does not happen with the Nsp2-deleted virus, indicating Nsp2\u2019s role in directing GIGYF2 to DMVs. Using formaldehyde crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments (fCLIP-seq), we found that GIGYF2 interacts with viral RNAs, particularly in regions encoding Nsp3, M, and Orf6. Depletion of GIGYF2 resulted in decreased expression of these proteins. Our findings reveal the function of Nsp2 in supporting viral protein production by exploiting GIGYF2 as a host factor.",

        "title": "Cannabidiol Potentiates p53-Driven Autophagic Cell Death in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Following DNA Damage: A Novel Synergistic Approach Beyond Canonical Pathways",
        "abstract": "The search for more effective and safer cancer therapies has led to an increasing interest in combination treatments that use well-established agents. This study explores the potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a compound derived from cannabis, to enhance the anticancer effects of etoposide in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although CBD is primarily used to manage childhood epilepsy, its broader therapeutic applications are being actively investigated, particularly in oncology. Our results revealed that among various tested chemotherapeutic drugs, etoposide showed the most significant reduction in NSCLC cell viability when combined with CBD. To understand this synergistic effect, we conducted extensive transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, which showed that the combination of CBD and etoposide upregulated genes associated with autophagic cell death, while downregulating key oncogenes known to drive tumor progression. This dual effect on cell death and oncogene suppression was mediated by inactivation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of cell growth and survival, and was dependent on the p53 status. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that this combination therapy did not rely on traditional cannabinoid receptors or transient receptor potential cation channels, indicating that CBD exerts its anti-cancer effects through novel, non-canonical mechanisms. The findings suggest that the combination of CBD with etoposide could represent a groundbreaking approach to NSCLC treatment, particularly in cases where conventional therapies fail. By inducing autophagic cell death and inhibiting oncogenic pathways, this therapeutic strategy offers a promising new avenue for enhancing treatment efficacy in NSCLC, especially in tumors with intact p53 function.",
