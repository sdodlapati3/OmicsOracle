        "abstract": "Background and Aims: Liver injury after COVID-19 vaccination is very rare and shows clinical and histomorphological similarities with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Little is known about the pathophysiology of COVID-19 vaccine-induced liver injury (VILI) and its relationship to AIH. Therefore, we compared VILI with AIH.  Methods: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded liver biopsy samples from patients with VILI (n=6) and from patients with an initial diagnosis of AIH (n=9) were included. Both cohorts were compared by histomorphological evaluation, whole-transcriptome and spatial transcriptome sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence and immune repertoire sequencing.  Results: Histomorphology was similar in both cohorts but showed more pronounced centrilobular necrosis in VILI. Gene expression profiling showed that mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress-related pathways were more and interferon response pathways less enriched in VILI. Multiplex analysis revealed that inflammation in VILI was dominated by CD8+ effector T cells, similar to drug-induced autoimmune like hepatitis (DI-AILH). In contrast, AIH showed a dominance of CD4+ effector T cells and CD79a+ B and plasma cells. T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing showed that T- and B-cell clones were more dominant in VILI than in AIH. In addition, many T-cell clones detected in the liver were also found in the blood. Interestingly, analysis of TCR beta chain and Ig heavy chain variable-joining gene usage further showed that TRBV6-1, TRBV5-1, TRBV7-6 and IgHV1-24 genes are used differently in VILI than in AIH.   Conclusions: Our analyses support that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced liver injury is related to AIH but also shows distinct differences from AIH in histomorphology, pathway activation, cellular immune infiltrates, and TCR usage. VILI may be a separate entity, which is distinct from AIH and more closely related to DI-AILH.",

The symptoms of the disease vary from mild reactions to severe respiratory distress or even fatal outcomes probably due to the different status of innate immunity which is the first line to combat the virus. Here in the study, we unveiled the underlying transcriptional patterns of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with different severity and outcome. Through systemic analysis, an anti-microbe peptide, \u03b1-defensin-1 (DEFA1) was identified to be elevated in both plasma and PBMCs in COVID19 patients, and the function and mechanism is studied.",

This data is valuable for research as it provides insights into the immune response alterations associated with severe COVID-19, which could inform the development of prognostic markers and therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the hyper-inflammatory responses characteristic of severe cases.",
            "brief": "The dataset GSE202805 investigates the transcriptomic alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients experiencing acute severe illness compared to convalescents, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation and severe disease progression. Utilizing global transcriptomic analysis on 80 samples, this study provides critical insights into the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting potential biomarkers for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic targets, thereby enhancing our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and informing future plasma analysis research."
