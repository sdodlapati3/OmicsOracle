        "abstract": "A key pathological feature of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is the loss of nuclear localization and the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells.",

        "abstract": "Seasonal morphological brain plasticity plays a key role in driving adaptive behavioural responses. Structural changes in the brain including the hippocampus and amygdala (nucleus taeniae in birds), across photoperiods are thought to underlie seasonal shifts in emotional state. For humans, this includes manifestations of short photoperiod seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While morphological brain changes are well documented, the associated transcriptomic dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the transcriptomes of the hippocampus and amygdala or nucleus taeniae in two highly photoperiodic species, the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), to identify transcriptomic changes underpinning seasonal shifts in emotional state. Hamsters and quail exhibited robust physiological changes between long and short photoperiod treatment. Under short photoperiod, hamsters displayed anxiety-like behaviour (increased grooming) in the open field test, consistent with a SAD-like phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis of the amygdala in hamsters identified 76 significantly differentially expressed (DE) transcripts (including transthyretin, TTR) and prolactin receptor, PRLR as differentially expressed, but not significantly. In the quail nucleus taeniae, we found 54 DE transcripts (including tenascin-C, TNC). In the hamster hippocampus, 14 DE transcripts were found, including mahogunin ring finger-1 (MGRN1), and 31 in the quail hippocampus, including eyes absent-2 (Eya2). These findings provide novel insights into the transcriptomic mechanisms underpinning seasonal affective states and suggest conserved roles for prolactin and thyroid hormone signalling in mediating seasonal changes in physiology and affective behaviour, particularly in the Siberian hamster.",

Here we report that the hypoxic TME imprints persistent activity of the central transcriptional node of the integrated stress response (ISR), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), in CD8+ TILs that results in metabolic polarity, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and cell death. Chronic ATF4 expression replicated the terminal exhaustion cell state in CD8+ T cells and high Atf4 expression in bulk tumor or peripheral T cells of patients with melanoma predicted poor response to PD-1 inhibition. Genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of ATF4 reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and promoted viability among CD8+ TILs, enabling complete responses to PD-1 inhibition and conferring protection from re-emergent disease. Our multidisciplinary approach identifies chronic ATF4 activity as a barrier to immune checkpoint inhibitors, positioning ISR therapeutics as novel treatment strategies to improve efficacy of immunotherapy combinations.",

In this study, tumor-reactive TILs (tr-TILs) are isolated and enriched for CD137 expression from cavitron ultrasonic aspirator (CUSA) emulsions of 161 adult patients diagnosed with diffuse gliomas. Tr-TILs are successfully expanded in 87 out of the 161 patients, reflecting an expansion rate of 54%. Notably, the presence of IDH1 mutation and the cumulative dose of steroids are identified as significant negative predictors of expansion efficacy. The expanded tr-TILs exhibit distinct phenotypic and molecular dysfunctional features yet show upregulated expression of progenitor/memory-like markers and polyclonal T-cell receptors. Importantly, these tr-TILs demonstrate specific antitumor reactivity against autologous tumor cells in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. These findings provide a compelling background for a personalized immunotherapeutic approach while tackling one of the most significant challenges in oncology.",

        "abstract": "Precise DNA replication is critical to the maintenance of genome stability, and the DNA replication machinery is a focal point of many current and upcoming chemotherapeutics. TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples, and does not require cell synchronisation, drug treatment, labelling or sorting. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication initiation zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb).  Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first ~1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced initiation zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors.",

While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGF\u03b2-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGF\u03b2 expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.",

The disease is caused by mutations in either VPS33B or VIPAS39. ARC syndrome is currently incurable, with patients rarely surviving beyond their first year of life. The renal component of this disorder is characterised by proximal tubular dysfunction. Here, a proximal tubular cell line, RPTEC-TERT1, was CRISPR-edited to knock out (KO) VPS33B expression. Characterisation of VPS33B-KO cells was performed using brightfield imaging, immunostaining, RNA sequencing, and cell detachment assays. The VPS33B-KO RPTEC-TERT1 cells demonstrated a 'peeling' phenotype and altered cell adhesion. This, along with altered transcription of genes associated with cell adhesion, suggests that VPS33B KO results in cell-matrix attachment defects. These findings provide the first insights into the cause of proximal tubular dysfunction in ARC syndrome.",
