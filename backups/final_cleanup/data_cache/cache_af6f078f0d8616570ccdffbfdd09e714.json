        "abstract": "Breast cancer remains one of the prominent causes of death worldwide. Although chemotherapeutic agents often result in substantial reduction of primary or metastatic tumors, remaining drug-tolerant tumor cell populations, known as minimal residual disease (MRD), pose a significant risk of recurrence and therapy resistance. In this study, we describe the spatiotemporal organisation of therapy response and MRD in BRCA1;p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors and human clinical samples using a multimodal approach. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and imaging mass cytometry across multiple treatment timepoints, we characterise dynamic interactions between tumor cell subpopulations and their surrounding microenvironment. Our analysis identifies a distinct, drug-tolerant epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cancer cell population, which exhibits a conserved expression program in human BRCA1-deficient tumors and significantly correlates with adverse clinical outcomes. We further reveal the spatial distribution of residual EMT-like tumor cells within specific anatomical niches, providing a framework for understanding the persistence of MRD and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. These findings yield a comprehensive molecular roadmap of MRD, opening new avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting EMT-driven drug tolerance and tumor relapse.",

To minimise genetic variability, all tumors originated from two parental tumors that were subdivided before transplantation. Tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed at baseline or treated with a single dose of cisplatin or TAC therapy (doxorubicin, docetaxel, and cyclophosphamide). Spatial transcriptomics (ST) was applied to primary (n = 10), residual (n = 16), recurrent (n = 4) tumor sections, and healthy mammary glands (n = 2), (total n = 32). Residual tumors were collected at 7 (TAC: n = 2, Cisplatin: n = 2) or 12 days (TAC: n = 4, Cisplatin: n = 3) post-treatment. Recurrent tumors were harvested upon regrowth (TAC: n = 2, Cisplatin: n = 2). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the canton of Bern (Switzerland) and are in accordance with the current Swiss Acts on Animal Experimentation. Additionally, tumor samples from five women carrying germline BRCA1 mutations were collected at surgery. ST was performed on primary (n = 2) and residual (n = 3) tumors (after neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Patients were treated at Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland.

        "title": "CD105+ fibroblasts support an immunosuppressive niche in women at high risk of breast cancer initiation",
        "abstract": "Background: Aging is the greatest risk factor for breast cancer, and although epithelial cells are the source of carcinomas, epithelial changes alone do not fully explain cancer susceptibility. Fibroblasts and macrophages are key stromal constituents around the cells of origin for cancer in breast tissue. With age, macrophages surrounding terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs) become increasingly immunosuppressive. CD105+ fibroblasts intercalate within TDLUs, drive luminal differentiation, and give rise to immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts in other tissues. We propose that differences in fibroblasts are a crucial component of the stroma that shapes cancer susceptibility. Methods: Primary fibroblast cultures were established from prophylactic and reduction mammoplasties from women ranging in age from 16 to 70 years and breast cancer risk (BRCA1 mutation carriers). Growth characteristics, transcriptional profiles, differentiation potential, and secreted proteins were profiled for fibroblast subtypes from diverse donors. Co-cultures with fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells were used to ascertain the functional role played by CD105+ fibroblasts in immune cell modulation. Results: We found that peri-epithelial CD105+ fibroblasts are enriched in older women as well as women who carry BRCA1 mutations. These CD105+ fibroblasts exhibit robust adipogenesis and secrete factors related to macrophage polarization. Macrophages cocultured with fibroblasts better maintain or enhance polarization states than media alone. CD105+ fibroblasts increased expression of immunosuppressive macrophage genes. CD105+ fibroblasts supported anti-inflammatory macrophage-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation, whereas CD105\u2212 fibroblasts significantly reduced the suppressive effect of anti-inflammatory macrophages on T cell proliferation. Conclusions: Establishment of a coculture system to dissect the molecular circuits between CD105+ fibroblasts and macrophages that drive immunosuppressive macrophage polarization has broad utility in understanding mammary gland development and events that precede cancer initiation. CD105+ fibroblasts and macrophages may coordinate to suppress immunosurveillance and increase breast cancer susceptibility.",

Here, we combine single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic data to reconstitute sequences of events in luminal cells that lead to tumorigenesis. Upon deletion of Trp53 and Brca1, we find that luminal progenitors display an extensive epigenomic disorder associated with a loss of cell identity.

        "abstract": "Background: Cells deficient in DNA repair factors breast cancer susceptibility 1/2 (BRCA1/2) or ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) are sensitive to poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Building on our previous findings, we asked how the lysine methyltransferase SETD1A contributed to PARP inhibitor-mediated cell death and determined the mechanisms responsible.  Methods: We used cervical, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells bearing mutations in BRCA1 or ATM and depleted SETD1A using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. We assessed the effects of the PARPi Olaparib on cell viability, homologous recombination, and DNA repair. We assessed underlying transcriptional perturbations using RNAseq. We also used data from The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) to investigate overall patient survival.  Results: Loss of SETD1A from both BRCA1-deficient and ATM-deficient cancer cells was associated with resistance to Olaparib, explained by an partial restoration of homologous recombination.  Mechanistically, SETD1A-dependent transcription of the crossover junction endonuclease EME1 correlated with sensitivity to Olaparib in these cells. Accordingly, when SETD1A or EME1 was lost, BRCA1 or ATM-mutated cells became resistant to Olaparib, and homologous recombination was partially restored.  Conclusions: Loss of SETD1A or EME1 may explain why patients develop resistance to PARP inhibitors in the clinic.",

In this genetically-unstable context, a recurrent major shift in cell identity occurs within the mammary epithelium. Basal-like BRCA1 tumors have indeed been proposed to originate from luminal progenitor cells yet tumor-initiating events remain poorly understood. Here, we map the state transitions leading luminal progenitors to tumor formation, using a mouse model launching tumorigenesis in multiple LP cells. We identify a population of cycling p16-expressing cells, emerging from the luminal progenitor compartment, undergoing partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and losing luminal identity. Pseudo-temporal analyses position these cells as a transitory state between aberrant Brca1-deficient luminal progenitors and growing tumor cells. Concomitant to p16 activation, we show that LP cells undergo an epigenomic crisis attested by the general re-organization of their heterochromatin. They accumulate multiple H3K27me3 micro-foci - reminiscent of the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) - and lose their inactive X (Xi). Both p16 activation and heterochromatin reorganization are hallmarks of human basal-like breast tumors, we propose that these events occur during initial LP transformation and are scars of an initial transitory senescent-like state.",

Here, we searched for potential drivers based on germline DNA analysis from a cohort consisting of early-onset breast cancer patients negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. This revealed candidate genes that subsequently were subjected to RNAi-based phenotype screens to reveal genome integrity impacts. We identified several genes with functional roles in genome maintenance, including Glucose-6-Phosphatase Catalytic Subunit 3 (G6PC3), SMC4, and CCDC108. Notably, G6PC3-deficient cells exhibited increased levels of \u03b3H2AX and micronuclei formation, along with defects in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Consistent with these observations, G6PC3 was required for the efficient recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). RNA sequencing analysis revealed that G6PC3 promotes the expression of multiple homologous recombination repair genes, including BRCA1. Through CRISPR-Select functional-genetic phenotype analysis of G6PC3 germline mutations, we identified two germline G6PC3 variants displaying partial loss-of-function. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that G6pc3 deficiency accelerates mammary tumor formation induced by TP53 loss in mice. In conclusion, our cohort-based functional analysis has unveiled genome maintenance factors and identified G6PC3 as a potential new tumor suppressor in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) contributes to genomic instability and leads to sensitivity to poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). HRD also activates the cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS)-STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING)-Interferon (IFN) pathway, highlighting the need to understand the impact of cGAS-STING-IFN signaling on PARPi efficacy. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of thirty-five breast cancer (BC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and mouse-derived allografts (MDA). PARPi sensitivity correlated with HRD, increased genomic instability, and activation of the cGAS-STING-IFN signaling pathway. Single-cell analyses showed that IFN signaling and IFN-based immune interactions were suppressed in preclinical models with acquired resistance to PARPi, lacking concomitant clonal expansion of functional CD8+ T cells. However, the combination of PARPi and a novel STING agonist (STINGa) increased immune infiltration and resulted in superior antitumor activity in these tumors. Notably, the efficacy of PARPi monotherapy and the combination treatment with a STINGa was dependent on Natural Killer (NK) cells. In agreement, BC patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations and good responses to PARPi showed higher abundancy of CD56+ NK cells in the tumor microenvironment and treatment-engaged CD56bright NK cells in the peripheral immune compartment, compared to those with poor responses. Therefore, these findings propose the combination of PARPi and STINGa as a potential novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic response in patients with acquired PARPi resistance and highlight a pivotal role of NK cells in the PARPi antitumor activity.",

        "abstract": "Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) contributes to genomic instability and leads to sensitivity to poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). HRD also activates the cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS)-STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING)-Interferon (IFN) pathway, highlighting the need to understand the impact of cGAS-STING-IFN signaling on PARPi efficacy. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of thirty-five breast cancer (BC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and mouse-derived allografts (MDA). PARPi sensitivity correlated with HRD, increased genomic instability, and activation of the cGAS-STING-IFN signaling pathway. Single-cell analyses showed that IFN signaling and IFN-based immune interactions were suppressed in preclinical models with acquired resistance to PARPi, lacking concomitant clonal expansion of functional CD8+ T cells. However, the combination of PARPi and a novel STING agonist (STINGa) increased immune infiltration and resulted in superior antitumor activity in these tumors. Notably, the efficacy of PARPi monotherapy and the combination treatment with a STINGa was dependent on Natural Killer (NK) cells. In agreement, BC patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations and good responses to PARPi showed higher abundancy of CD56+ NK cells in the tumor microenvironment and treatment-engaged CD56bright NK cells in the peripheral immune compartment, compared to those with poor responses. Therefore, these findings propose the combination of PARPi and STINGa as a potential novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic response in patients with acquired PARPi resistance and highlight a pivotal role of NK cells in the PARPi antitumor activity.",
