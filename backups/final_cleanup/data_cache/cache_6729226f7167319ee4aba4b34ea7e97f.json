        "abstract": "The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection mostly represented by asymptomatic or mild, however a small but relevant proportion of patients develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by an excessive, host immune response with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can rapidly lead to multi-organ failure and death. Indeed, immune pathologies are well characterised through deep immune phenotyping, plasma analysis, sc-RNA and chip based methylation analysis, still we lack a molecular understanding of immune pathologies associated with COVID-19 which is urgently needed for new prognostic and therapeutic interventions. In this study, we first time showed a SARS-Cov2 induced severity associated deregulation of immune functions driven through a global reprogramming of immune functions through a epigenetically driven gene regulatory network",

        "abstract": "Fatal COVID-19 is often complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanisms governing lung injury and repair in ARDS remain poorly understood because there are no biomarker-targeted therapeutics for patients with ARDS. We hypothesized that plasma proteomics may uncover unique biomarkers that correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 ARDS. We analyzed the circulating plasma proteome from 32 patients with ARDS and COVID-19 using an aptamer-based platform, which measures 7289 proteins, and correlated protein measurements with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores at 2 time points (Days 1 and 7 following ICU admission). We compared differential protein abundance and SOFA scores at each individual time point and identified 119 proteins at Day 1 and 46 proteins at Day 7 that correlated with patient SOFA scores. We modeled the relationship between dynamic protein abundance and changes in SOFA score between Days 1 and 7 and identified 39 proteins that significantly correlated with changes in SOFA score. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified increased ephrin signaling and acute phase response signaling correlated with increased SOFA scores over time, while pathways related to pulmonary fibrosis signaling and wound healing had an inverse relationship with SOFA scores between Days 1 and 7. These findings suggest that persistent inflammation may drive worsened disease severity, while repair processes correlate with improvements in organ dysfunction over time. This approach is generalizable to more diverse ARDS cohorts for identification of protein biomarkers and disease mechanisms as we strive towards targeted therapies in ARDS.",

Here, we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the immunological state at baseline and following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination of lung transplant (LTX) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Our analysis revealed a baseline immune profile in LTX patients that mirrors the immune alterations observed in severe COVID-19 cases and sepsis.

In addition to these alterations, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed 4 transcriptionally distinct clusters of classical monocytes in HC, with a striking enrichment of a unique classical monocyte cluster in LTX patients, differing from the predominant classical monocytes in HC, marked by heightened expression of the S100A family and reduced expression of genes related to cytokine production and antigen presentation. Following vaccination, LTX patients displayed a reduced magnitude and breadth of binding and neutralizing antibody responses, and impaired memory B and T cell responses.

        "abstract": "Background Omicron subvariants have led to millions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. Although Omicron breakthrough infections (BTIs) exhibit lower hospitalization rates than previous variants, post-COVID conditions persist. However, the immune response dynamics, lymphocyte subsets, and immune repertoire features following BA.5 sublineage BTI remain poorly understood. Methods In a longitudinal cohort, we monitored the recovery dynamics in patients with BTI at various time points. We employed single-cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor (TCR)/BCR sequencing, and antibody mass spectrometry to sequentially assess the immune response following BA.5.2 or BF.7 BTI. Findings Serological analysis revealed active cellular and humoral immunity 2 weeks post-BTI, with significant increases in cytokines (CKs) like IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b2, IL-2, and neutralizing antibodies. CK levels reverted to pre-infection levels, while broadly neutralizing antibodies remained high 1 month post-infection. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated robust immune activation and antiviral responses in NK, T, and B lymphocytes within 1 month post-BTI. Interestingly, the immune system maintained its strength to combat viral infection at 2 weeks post-BTI, transitioning toward repair and tissue damage elimination at 1 month. TCR/BCR library analysis revealed a higher clonal type in the BTI_2w group, mainly in NKT, memory T or B, and plasma cells, crucial for immune memory and antigen clearance. The BTI_1m group exhibited more IgG and IgA BCR subtypes, with somatic hypermutation indicating mature antibodies. Biological function verification of IgG and IgA-type monoclonal antibodies corresponding to expanded BCRs revealed antigen-specific and broad-spectrum antibodies. Interpretation Our study elucidated the dynamic immune profiling of individuals 2 weeks and 1 month after Omicron BA.5 sublineage BTI. This provided essential insights into pathogenicity, sequential immune status, recovery mechanisms of Omicron subvariant BTI, and novel concepts for broad-spectrum antibody development.",

        "abstract": "How to develop highly informative serology assays to evaluate the quality of immune protection against COVID-19 has been a global pursuit over the past years including the NCI SeroNet initiative. Despite the wide-spread adoption of vaccination that has demonstrated exceptional efficacy, patients with altered immunity such as hematologic malignancies and autoimmune disease remain at risk, requiring rapid serological as well as immunological evaluation at the full range to manage these patients. Here, we develop a microfluidic high-plex immuno-serolomic assay to simultaneously measure up to 50 plasma or serum samples for up to 50 soluble markers including 35 plasma proteins, 11 anti-spike/RBD IgG antibodies spanning all major variants, and controls. Our assay demonstrates the quintuplicate test in a single run with high throughput, low sample volume input, high reproducibility and high accuracy. It is applied to the measurement of 1,012 blood samples including in-depth analysis of sera from 127 patients and 21 healthy donors over multiple time points, either with acute COVID infection or vaccination. The protein association matrix analysis reveals distinct immune mediator protein modules that exhibit a reduced degree of diversity in protein-protein cooperation in patients with hematologic malignancies and patients with autoimmune disorders receiving B cell depletion therapy. Serological analysis identifies that COVID infected patients with hematologic malignancies display impaired anti-RBD antibody response despite high level of anti-spike IgG, which could be associated with limited clonotype diversity and functional deficiency in B cells and is further confirmed by single-cell BCR and transcriptome sequencing. These findings underscore the importance to individualize immunization strategy for these high-risk patients and provide an informative tool to monitor their responses at the systems level.",

Recent evidence indicates that the plasma levels of specific miRNAs may be significantly modified in COVID-19 patients. Large-scale deep sequencing analysis of small RNA expression was performed on plasma samples from 40 patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (between March and May 2020) (median 13.50 [IQR 9\u201324] days since symptoms initiation) and 21 healthy noninfected individuals. Patients were categorized as hospitalized not requiring oxygen therapy (n = 6), hospitalized requiring low-flow oxygen (n = 23), and hospitalized requiring high-flow oxygen support (n = 11). A total of 1218 different micro(mi)RNAs were identified. When compared with healthy noninfected donors, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed significantly (fold change [FC] >1.2 and adjusted p [padj] <0.05) altered expression of 190 miRNAs. The top 10 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were miR-122-5p, let-7b-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-342-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-629-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-12136, let-7a-5p, and miR-191-5p, which displayed FC and padj values ranging from 153 to 5 and 2.51 \u00d7 10-32 to 2.21 \u00d7 10-21, respectively, which unequivocally diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. No differences in blood cell counts and biochemical plasma parameters, including interleukin 6, ferritin and D-dimer, were observed between COVID-19 patients on high-flow oxygen therapy, low-flow oxygen therapy, or not requiring oxygen therapy. Notably, 31 significantly deregulated miRNAs were found when patients on high- and low-flow oxygen therapy were compared. Similarly, 6 DE miRNAs were identified between patients on high flow and those not requiring oxygen therapy. SARS-CoV-2 infection generates a specific miRNA signature in hospitalized patients.

        "abstract": "The blood proteome holds great promise for precision medicine but poses daunting challenges due to the low abundance of the majority of plasma proteins and the vast dynamic range across the proteome. We report the development and validation of a novel proteomic analysis technology \u2013 NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA\u2122) \u2013 that incorporates a dual capture and release mechanism to suppress the assay background to the minimum, thus drastically improving the signal-to-noise ratio. NULISA improves the sensitivity of the proximity ligation assay by over 10,000-fold to the attomolar level, which is enabled by antibody-conjugated DNA sequences that mediate the purification of immunocomplexes and contain target-and sample-specific barcodes for next-generation sequencing-based, highly multiplexed analysis. To demonstrate its performance and utility, we developed a 200-plex NULISA targeting 124 cytokines and chemokines and 80 other immune response-related proteins that demonstrated superior sensitivity for detecting low-abundance proteins and high concordance with other immunoassays. The ultra-high sensitivity enabled the detection of previously difficult-to-detect but biologically important, low-abundance biomarkers in patients with autoimmune diseases and COVID-19. Fully automated NULISA uniquely addresses longstanding challenges in the proteomic analysis of liquid biopsy samples and makes broad and in-depth proteomic analysis accessible to the general research community and future diagnostic applications.",
