        "abstract": "Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) contributes to genomic instability and leads to sensitivity to poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). HRD also activates the cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS)-STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING)-Interferon (IFN) pathway, highlighting the need to understand the impact of cGAS-STING-IFN signaling on PARPi efficacy. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of thirty-five breast cancer (BC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and mouse-derived allografts (MDA). PARPi sensitivity correlated with HRD, increased genomic instability, and activation of the cGAS-STING-IFN signaling pathway. Single-cell analyses showed that IFN signaling and IFN-based immune interactions were suppressed in preclinical models with acquired resistance to PARPi, lacking concomitant clonal expansion of functional CD8+ T cells. However, the combination of PARPi and a novel STING agonist (STINGa) increased immune infiltration and resulted in superior antitumor activity in these tumors. Notably, the efficacy of PARPi monotherapy and the combination treatment with a STINGa was dependent on Natural Killer (NK) cells. In agreement, BC patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations and good responses to PARPi showed higher abundancy of CD56+ NK cells in the tumor microenvironment and treatment-engaged CD56bright NK cells in the peripheral immune compartment, compared to those with poor responses. Therefore, these findings propose the combination of PARPi and STINGa as a potential novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic response in patients with acquired PARPi resistance and highlight a pivotal role of NK cells in the PARPi antitumor activity.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 can induce synthetic lethality in tumors characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BRCA1/2 mutant cancers, potentially including patients whose tumors have primary or acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of TNG348, an allosteric, selective, and reversible inhibitor of USP1 (USP1i). TNG348 induces dose-dependent accumulation of ubiquitinated protein substrates both in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR screens show that TNG348 exerts its anti-tumor effect by disrupting the translesion synthesis pathway of DNA damage tolerance through RAD18-dependent ub-PCNA induction. Though TNG348 and PARPi share the ability to selectively kill HRD tumor cells, CRISPR screens reveal that TNG348 and PARPi do so through discrete mechanisms. Particularly, knocking out PARP1 causes resistance to PARPi but sensitizes cells to TNG348 treatment.  Consistent with these findings, combination of TNG348 with PARPi leads to synergistic anti-tumor effects in HRD tumors, resulting in tumor growth inhibition and regression in multiple mouse xenograft tumor models. Importantly, our data in human cancer models further show that the addition of TNG348 to PARPi treatment can overcome acquired PARPi resistance in vivo. While the clinical development of TNG348 has been discontinued due to unexpected liver toxicity in patients (NCT06065059), the present data provides preclinical and mechanistic support for the continued exploration of USP1 as a drug target for the treatment of patients with BRCA1/2 mutant or HRD cancers.",

        "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is a dePARylating enzyme which promotes DNA repair by removal of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) from PARP1-parylated proteins.  Loss or inhibition of PARG results in replication stress and sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damaging agents, suggesting that PARG inhibitors may provide a therapeutic option for cancer therapy. Indeed, PARG inhibitors (PARGi) are now undergoing clinical development for patients having tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as ovarian and breast cancer patients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2-mutations. Biomarkers of PARGi response will be required for the optimal development of these important new drugs. PARP inhibitors kill BRCA-deficient cancer cells by increasing ssDNA gaps during replication. Here, we report that, similar to PARP inhibitors, PARGi treatment can also cause an accumulation of ssGAPs in sensitive cells. PARGi exposure increased accumulation of S-Phase specific PAR, a marker for Okazaki fragment processing (OFP) defects on lagging strands, in sensitive cells but not in resistant cells.  PARGi also caused accumulation of PAR at the replication fork and increased pRPA, a marker for replication stress, at the replication fork in sensitive cells. Additionally, PARGi exhibited monotherapy activity in some HR-deficient, as well as HR-proficient,  patient-derived organoids of ovarian cancer, and drug sensitivity directly correlated with the accumulation of ssDNA gaps. Taken together, PARGi treatment results in toxic accumulation of PAR at replication forks resulting in ssDNA gaps due to OFP defects during replication. Regardless of the BRCA-status, the induction of ssDNA gaps in preclinical models of ovarian cancer cells correlates with PARGi sensitivity. Patient-derived organoids will be a useful model system for testing PARGi sensitivity and functional biomarkers",

Here, we engineered adipocytes to outcompete tumors for nutrients and show that they can substantially reduce cancer progression. Growing cells from several cancers (breast, colon, pancreas, prostate) with engineered human adipocytes or xenografts alongside adipose organoids significantly suppresses cancer progression and reduces hypoxia and angiogenesis. Transplanting modulated adipocyte organoids in pancreatic or breast cancer genetic mouse models significantly suppressed their growth and decreased angiogenesis and hypoxia. To further showcase therapeutic potential, we demonstrate that co-culturing engineered patient-derived adipocytes with tumor organoids from dissected human breast cancers significantly reduces cancer growth and reduces proliferation of organoids from donors with BRCA1/2 mutations. In addition, inducing adipose organoids to outcompete tumors via tetracycline or placing them in an integrated cell-scaffold delivery platform and implanting them next to the tumor, both significantly suppress cancer growth. Finally, to display how this approach can be customized for different tumor-associated metabolic programs, we show that upregulating UPP1 in adipose organoids can outcompete a uridine-dependent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for resources and suppress its growth. Combined, our results introduce a novel cancer therapeutic approach, termed adipose modulation transplantation (AMT), that can be utilized for a broad range of cancers.",

        "abstract": "Women carrying BRCA1 (B1) mutations face an elevated risk of developing breast cancer, yet effective preventive strategies remain limited. To design innovative strategies, it is critical to understand the early events driving tumorigenesis. Here we present a unique mouse model which is conditionally heterozygous for B1 and deleted for Trp53, specifically in the mammary epithelial cells, and forms triple-negative mammary tumors under replication stress. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, spanning various stages of mammary tumorigenesis in this model, reveals early tumor-promoting transcriptomic alterations. We identify a distinct, proliferative bi-potent cell population expressing both luminal progenitor and basal epithelial markers, uniquely enriched in Brca1 heterozygous mammary tissue upon replication stress. Notably, the transcriptomic changes in this population correlate with poor outcomes in human breast cancer. Transcriptomic analysis, combined with transcription factor analysis, along the trajectory from normal to precancerous and tumor stages, implicates the AP-1 complex, specifically the FRA-1 transcription factor, as an early driver in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer. Furthermore, pseudo-time analysis along this trajectory identifies alveolar luminal progenitor cells as the likely cell-of-origin. Luminal cells also show reduced efficiency of DNA damage repair when compared to basal cells. In conclusion, we have established the first Brca1 heterozygous mouse model for studying the effects of DNA replication stress on breast cancer and have identified early precancerous transcriptomic changes stemming from BRCA1 haploinsufficiency and replication stress. This study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers.",

However, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (n>5000) limit the clinical use of testing results. Thus, there is an urgent need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants. Here we report on comprehensive saturation genome editing-based functional characterization of 99% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the BRCA2 DNA Binding Domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants that is encoded by exons 15 to 26. The assay was based on deep sequence analysis of HAP1 haploid cells endogenously targeted using a CRISPR/cas9 knockin approach. A total of 6959 SNVs were characterized for effects on cell survival. The assay was validated relative to nonsense and synonymous variants, ClinVar pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign variants and homology directed repair cell based DNA repair assay results, all of which showed >94% sensitivity and specificity. Variants were assigned posterior probabilities of pathogenicity using a VarCall two component Bayesian mixture model and were further grouped according to ACMG strength of evidence under the PS3/BS3 rule resulting in Benign Strong (n=5430), Benign Moderate (n=190), Benign Supporting (n=61), VUS (122), Pathogenic Strong (n=1021), Pathogenic Moderate (n=88), and Pathogenic Supporting (n=47). Breast cancer case-control association studies showed that pooled SNVs encoding functionally pathogenic missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast (odds ratio (OR)3.81, 95%CI: 2.88-5.07) and ovarian cancer (OR 5.93, 95%CI: 4.12-8.52). The functional data were also combined with other sources of information in the ClinGen BRCA1/2 VCEP ACMG/AMP-classification model. A total of 785 SNVs, including 261 missense SNVs, were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, while 5566 SNVs, including 3786 missense SNVs, were classified as benign or likely benign.

        "abstract": "CDK4/6 inhibitors act as a cytostatic by targeting CDK4/6-cyclin D, and have achieved great success in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treatment. Beyond cell cycle signaling pathway, recent research on non-cell cycle related functions of CDK4/6 has been blooming. Insights in this field may expand the therapeutic benefits of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Here, we attempt to explore the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors on breast cancer from the perspective of epigenetic modifications, especially histone modifications, through high-throughput proteomic and genomics approaches. We reveal that inhibition of CDK4 directly suppresses phosphorylation of p300, an acetyltransferase, stimulates its ubiquitin degradation, and down-regulates the histone H3K27ac. Then, p300-mediated transcriptionally inhibition of BRCA1 and enrichment of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) gene signatures lead to the increase of the proportion of ALDH1+ breast CSCs in ER+ breast cancer after long treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. our results reveal a novel phosphorylation substrate of CDK4/cyclin D complex, and offer an unrecognized side effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors, inducing stem cell properties in ER+ breast cancer.",

            "overview": "This study investigates the spatiotemporal organization of minimal residual disease (MRD) in BRCA1;p53-deficient mammary tumors, focusing on how these drug-tolerant tumor cell populations interact with their microenvironment following chemotherapy. Utilizing a multimodal approach that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and imaging mass cytometry across various treatment timepoints, the researchers characterize the dynamics of tumor cell subpopulations. This dataset is valuable for understanding the mechanisms of therapy resistance in BRCA1-related breast cancer, providing insights that could inform the development of targeted therapies to combat MRD and reduce recurrence risk.",
            "brief": "The dataset GSE299631 investigates the spatiotemporal organization of minimal residual disease (MRD) in BRCA1;p53-deficient mammary tumors, addressing the biological question of how drug-tolerant tumor cell populations interact with their microenvironment post-therapy. Utilizing a multimodal approach that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and imaging mass cytometry across various treatment timepoints, this study reveals critical insights into the dynamics of tumor cell subpopulations and their resilience mechanisms. This data is valuable for BRCA1 breast cancer research as it enhances understanding of MRD's role in therapy resistance and recurrence, potentially guiding the development of more effective treatment strategies."
