        "abstract": "Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders through genetic studies. However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis -expression QTLs (eQTLs). Together, we provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic database of the human microglia responsome.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, transcriptome analysis has been widely used to understand human disease pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Accumulated reports in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, have also provided evidence of dysregulated gene expression related to neuropathogenesis. However, obtaining samples from neurodegenerative patients is more challenging than other human diseases due to low accessibility. Also, brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid are composed of multiple cell types, so they are unsuitable for obtaining neural cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Thus, we here report gene expression profiles in primary neuronal cultures exposed to A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity to understand pathological gene expression in neurons. By RNA-sequencing analysis, we compare transcriptomes and find that two groups of genes show similar expression patterns in A\u03b2 toxicity excitotoxicity\u2014they are either up- or down-regulated in both conditions. Genes in the two groups are related to synaptic function and cell signaling, which are well-known biological functions altered in A\u03b2 toxicity and excitotoxicity. Interestingly, the analysis reveals a possibility that circadian clock (molecular oscillator generating daily rhythms)-related genes are dysregulated in both conditions. We confirm the reduced circadian transcription factor Bmal1 levels in A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity. RNA-sequencing analysis in Bmal1-deleted neurons shows potential relationships between BMAL1 and synaptic functions. Thus, this transcriptome study provides evidence of the potential roles of the circadian clock in neuropathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Microglia modulate their cell state in response to various stimuli. Changes to cellular lipids often accompany shifts in microglial cell state, but the functional significance of these metabolic changes remains poorly understood. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we observed that both extrinsic activation (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) and intrinsic triggers (the Alzheimer\u2019s disease-associated APOE4 genotype) result in accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. We demonstrate that lipid droplet accumulation is not simply concomitant with changes in cell state. In fact, both triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are necessary for the activation-induced transcription and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as the changes in phagocytosis of many substrates including the amyloid-beta peptide. In microglia harboring the Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk APOE4 genotype, inhibiting triglyceride biosynthesis modifies the transcription of immune response genes and attenuates disease-associated transcriptional states. In addition, this inhibition rescues microglial surveillance defects observed in slices from APOE4 humanized transgenic mice. Together, our findings establish that modulating triglyceride metabolism can be used to tune microglial immunometabolism in response to extrinsic activation and in APOE4-associated disease.",

        "abstract": "Microglia are the immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and become pro-inflammatory/activated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Cell surface glycosylation plays an important role in immune cells, however, the N-glycosylation and glycosphingolipid (GSL) signatures of activated microglia are poorly understood. Here, we study comprehensive combined transcriptomic and glycomic profiles using human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived microglia (hiMG). Distinct changes in N-glycosylation patterns in A\u03b2 oligomer (A\u03b2O) and LPS -treated hiMG were observed. In A\u03b2O treated cells, the relative abundance of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N-glycans decreased, corresponding with a downregulation of MGAT3, the gene responsible for bisecting GlcNAc N-glycan formation. The sialylation of N-glycans increased in response to A\u03b2O, accompanied by an upregulation of genes involved in N-glycan sialylation (ST3GAL2, 4, and 6). Moreover, we found that the N-glycosylation signature of LPS-induced hiMG differed from that of A\u03b2O-induced hiMG. LPS-induced hiMG exhibited a decreased abundance of complex-type N-glycans, aligned with downregulation of mannosidase genes (MAN1A1, MAN2A2, MAN1C1). Fucosylation increased in LPS-induced hiMG, aligned with upregulated fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) and downregulated alpha-L-fucosidase 1 (FUCA1) gene expression. However, the GSL profile did not exhibit significant changes in response to A\u03b2O or LPS activation. A\u03b2O- and LPS- specific glycosylation changes could contribute to impaired microglia function, highlighting glycosylation pathways as potential therapeutic targets for AD.",

The role of microglia, the macrophages of the Central Nervous System (CNS), was extensively researched in CNS neuropathologies. However, we only start to understand the role of T cells in diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Huntington\u2019s Disease (HD) and how microglial \u2013 T cell crosstalk contributes to these pathologies. Here we tackle these topics in a rare and less investigated disease called Spastic Paraplegia 15 (SPG15) using a Zfyve26-/- mouse model. We were able to show, that CD8+ T cells and microglia potentiate a pro-inflammatory response through bidirectional communication in SPG15 KO and not WT mouse brains. The increase of CD8+ T cells in SPG15 KO animals also required a TCR dependent component. These findings are in line with previous reports on neurodegenerative disease which hints at cross-condition mechanisms involved in CD8+T cell responses in CNS, when encountering accumulation of non-degradable material in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Current amyloid beta-targeting approaches for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) therapeutics only slow cognitive decline for small numbers of patients. This limited efficacy exists because AD is a multifactorial disease whose pathological mechanism(s) and diagnostic biomarkers are largely unknown. Here we report a new mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of a hippocampal proteome that defines the proteopathic nature of AD. Accordingly, we developed a novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, across the blood-brain barrier to block this G9a-regulated, proteopathologic mechanism. Intermittent MS1262 treatment of multiple AD mouse models consistently restored both cognitive and noncognitive functions to healthy levels. Comparison of proteomic/phosphoproteomic analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human AD patient data identified multiple pathological brain pathways that elaborate amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles as well as blood coagulation, from which biomarkers of early stage of AD including SMOC1 were found to be affected by MS1262 treatment. Notably, these results indicated that MS1262 treatment may reduce or avoid the risk of blood clot burst for brain bleeding or a stroke. This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteopathology suggests that the global, multifaceted effects of MS1262 in mice could extend to relieve all symptoms of AD patients with minimum side effect. In addition, our mechanistically derived biomarkers can be used for stage-specific AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.",

In addition, patient-derived human dermal fibroblast effectively reflect the molecular anomalies that disrupt cellular homeostasis. This study aimed to use an ex-vivo platform to characterize the transcriptional profile of fibroblasts derived from patients with AD in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and propose potential biomarkers.

Human leukocyte Ig-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) is an inhibitory receptor of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that is expressed on myeloid cells and recognizes apolipoprotein E (ApoE) among other ligands. LILRB4 expression and function in microglia has not been investigated. Here, we find that LILRB4 is highly expressed in microglia of patients with AD. Using mice that accumulate A\u03b2 andcarry a transgene encompassing a portion of the LILR region that includes LILRB4, we corroborated abundant LILRB4 expression in microglia wrapping A\u03b2 plaques. Systemic treatment of these mice with an anti-human LILRB4 monoclonal antibody (mAb)reduced A\u03b2 load,mitigated A\u03b2-related behavioral abnormalities, enhanced microglia phagocytosis and attenuated expression of interferon-induced genes.In vitrobinding experiments established that human LILRB4 binds both human and mouse ApoE and that anti-human LILRB4 mAb blocks such interaction.In silicomodeling, biochemical and mutagenesis analyses identified a loop between the two extracellular Ig domains of LILRB4 required for interaction with mouse ApoE and further indicated that anti-LILRB4 mAb may block LILRB4-mApoE by directly binding this loop. Thus, targeting LILRB4 may be a potential therapeutic avenue for AD.",

A key hallmark of AD, A\u03b2 oligomers, disrupt oligodendrocyte and myelin homeostasis, but a comprehensive global analysis of the mechanisms involved is lacking. Here, transcriptomic profiling of A\u03b2-exposed oligodendrocytes revealed widespread gene expression changes, particularly affecting pathways related to RNA localisation. Among the genes identified, we focused on Hnrnpa2/b1, the gene encoding the hnRNP A2 protein, which is essential for RNA transport and translation of myelin proteins. We confirmed aberrant upregulation of hnRNP A2 in hippocampal oligodendrocytes from post-mortem human brains of early-stage AD patients, A\u03b2-injected mouse hippocampi and A\u03b2-treated disrupting cells in vitro. RIP-seq analysis of the hnRNP A2 interactome revealed attenuated interactions with Hnrnpk and Hnrnpa2/b1, while interactions with Mbp and Mobp were enriched, suggesting changes in RNA metabolism of molecules associated with mRNA transport of myelin proteins. A\u03b2 increased the total number and dynamics of mRNA-containing granules, facilitating local translation of the myelin proteins MBP and MOBP and attenuating Ca2+ signalling. These findings suggest that A\u03b2 oligomers disrupt RNA metabolism mechanisms crucial for oligodendrocyte myelination through dysregulation of hnRNP A2 and myelin protein levels, potentially affecting oligodendroglia Ca2+ homeostasis.",

It is characterized by weakness, frequent falls, cognitive decline, increased hospitalization and dead, and represents a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The fact that frailty is recognized as a reversible condition, encourages the identification of earlier biomarkers to timely predict and prevent its occurrence. SAMP8 (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8) mice represent the most appropriate preclinical model to this aim and were used in this study to carry transcriptional and metabolic analyses in the brain and plasma respectively, upon a characterization at cognitive, motor, structural and neuropathological level at 2.5, 6 and 9 months of age. At 2.5 months SAMP8 mice started displaying memory deficits, muscle weakness and motor impairment. Functional alterations were associated with a neurodevelopment deficiency associated with reduced neuronal density and glial cell loss. Through transcriptomics we identified specific genetic signatures well distinguishing SAMP8 mice at 6 months and correlating with motor and cognitive dysfunction, whereas plasma metabolomics allowed to segregate SAMP8 mice from SAMR1 already at 2.5 months of age by detecting constitutively lower levels of acylcarnitines and lipids in SAMP8 at all ages investigated. Our findings suggest that specific genetic alterations at central level, as well as metabolomic changes in plasma, might allow to early assess a frail condition leading to dementia development, which paves the foundation for future investigation in a clinical setting.",
