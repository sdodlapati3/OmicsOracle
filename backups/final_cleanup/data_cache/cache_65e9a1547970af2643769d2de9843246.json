        "title": "MicroRNA-885-5p regulates cell cycle progression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for translational repression or degradation. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Here, we identify miR-885-5p as a novel tumor suppressor miRNA in HCC. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from TCGA and GEO databases revealed downregulation of miR-885-5p in HCC tissues. Overexpression of miR-885-5p significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation, supporting its tumor-suppressive role. Transcriptomic profiling of miR-885-5p-overexpressing HCC cells identified cell cycle as the most affected pathway by KEGG and GO analyses. Specifically, miR-885-5p induced downregulation of G1/S transition-promoting genes, including\u00a0CDK6,\u00a0E2F2, and\u00a0CCNA2, in HCC cells. Consequently, these cells exhibited reduced BrdU incorporation and G1 phase arrest. Dual luciferase assays confirmed direct interaction of miR-885-5p with the 3' untranslated regions of\u00a0CDK6,\u00a0E2F2, and\u00a0CCNA2\u00a0mRNAs. Furthermore, miR-885-5p overexpression sensitized HCC cells to the CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib. These findings demonstrate that miR-885-5p induces cell cycle arrest and enhances CDK4/6 inhibitor sensitivity in HCC, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "Inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) characterizes an immunogenic molecular subtype of prostate cancer, marked by genomic instability and increased intratumoral T cell infiltration. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenotype and its therapeutic implications remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CDK12 inactivation or suppression of its paralog CDK13 activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling across multiple cancer types. Analysis of clinical cohorts receiving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) revealed that reduced CDK12/13 expression correlates with improved survival and treatment response. Mechanistically, CDK12/13 depletion or targeted degradation induces transcription-replication conflicts and R-loop accumulation, triggering cytosolic DNA release and subsequent STING activation. Functionally, CDK12/13 degradation significantly delays tumor growth and exhibits synergistic effects with anti-PD1 therapy in various syngeneic tumor models. This combination enhances STING activity and promotes the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells within tumors. Notably, the anti-tumor effects of this combination require STING signaling and functional CD8+ T cells. These findings identify CDK12/13 as promising therapeutic targets for enhancing ICB efficacy, highlighting their potential to amplify STING-mediated anti-tumor immunity. This work provides a mechanistic framework for leveraging CDK12/13 antagonists in combination with ICB to improve clinical outcomes in cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Protein complexes are pivotal to most cellular processes. Emerging evidence indicates that pairs of ribosomes ubiquitously drive the synchronized synthesis and assembly of two protein subunits into homodimeric complexes1-5. These observations suggest protein folding mechanisms of general importance enabled by contacts between nascent chains6,7 \u2013 which have thus far rather been considered detrimental8,9. However, owing to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature, the folding of interacting nascent chains remains unexplored. Here, we show that co-translational ribosome pairing allows their nascent chains to \u2018chaperone each other\u2019, thus enabling the formation of coiled-coil homodimers from subunits that misfold individually. We developed an integrated single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy approach to probe the folding and assembly of two nascent chains extending from nearby ribosomes, using the intermediate filament lamin as a model system. Ribosome proximity in early translation stages was found to be critical: when interactions between nascent chains are inhibited or delayed, they become trapped in stable misfolded states that are no longer assembly-competent. Conversely, early interactions allow the two nascent chains to nucleate native-like quaternary structures that grow in size and stability as translation advances. We conjecture that protein folding mechanisms enabled by ribosome cooperation are more broadly relevant to intermediate filaments and other protein classes.",
