Because of their shared epidemiological associations, we conducted pleiotropic analysis of genome-wide association studies of lung cancer (12 160 lung cancer case patients and 16 838 control subjects) and cardiovascular disease risk factors (blood lipids from 188 577 subjects, type 2 diabetes from 148 821 subjects, body mass index from 123 865 subjects, and smoking phenotypes from 74 053 subjects). We found that 6p22.1 (rs6904596, ZNF184) was associated with both lung cancer (P = 5.50x10-6) and blood triglycerides (P = 1.39x10-5). We replicated the association in 6097 lung cancer case patients and 204 657 control subjects (P = 2.40\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4) and in 71 113 subjects with triglycerides data (P = .01). rs6904596 reached genome-wide significance in lung cancer meta-analysis (odds ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 1.10 to 1.21, Pcombined = 5.20x10-9). The large sample size provided by the lipid GWAS data and the shared genetic risk factors between the two traits contributed to the uncovering of a hitherto unidentified genetic locus for lung cancer.",

        "title": "Charting a dynamic DNA methylation landscape of the human genome",
        "abstract": "DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is essential for normal development. Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances we still have a too limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in depth analysis of 42 whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, a majority of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), which allow identification of key lineage specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often harbor SNPs associated with cell type related diseases as determined by GWAS. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of WGBS as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information regarding CpG methylation. To further demonstrate the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results confirm that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to help guide novel, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation-based classification of brain tumors has emerged as a powerful and indispensable diagnostic technique. Initial implementations have used methylation microarrays for data generation, but different sequencing approaches are increasingly used. Most current classifiers, however, rely on a fixed methylation feature space, rendering them incompatible with other platforms, especially different flavors of DNA sequencing. Here, we describe crossNN, a neural network-based machine learning framework which can accurately classify tumor entities using DNA methylation profiles obtained from different platforms and with different epigenome coverage and sequencing depth. It outperforms other deep and conventional machine learning models with respect to diagnostic accuracy and computational requirements while still being fully explainable. We use crossNN to train a pan-cancer classifier to discriminate more than 170 tumor types across all organ sites. Validation in an independent cohort of >5,000 tumors profiled using different microarray and sequencing platforms, including low-pass nanopore and targeted bisulfite sequencing, demonstrates the robustness and scalability of the model with 99.1% and 97.8% precision for brain tumor and pan-cancer model, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetic changes are implicated in repair and physiological responses of postnatal skeletal muscle (SkM) as well as in prenatal embryogenesis. This study examined the epigenomics and transcriptomics of human myoblasts (SkM progenitor cells) vs. those of diverse other cell and tissue types from both global genomic and single-gene perspectives. Using enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of myoblast DNA and available WGBS profiles of other cell cultures, we determined myoblast differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We also examined several DMRs in reporter gene assays. Among the unusual findings was the positive association of promoter-adjacent hypermethylation in myoblasts with transcription turn-on for some genes (e.g., SIM2 and TWIST1), but at down-modulated levels. In contrast, some genes, like the brain-specific OLIG2, were silent and embedded in repressed chromatin in myoblasts and many diverse cell populations but displayed myoblast-specific hypermethylated promoters. OLIG2 exhibited binding of the myogenic MYOD transcription factor in its vicinity. One OLIG2-downstream MYOD+ site overlapped enhancer chromatin in myotubes. These findings suggest that OLIG2 silencing only by repressive chromatin is insufficient in myoblasts without the addition of DNA hypermethylation. The numerous hypomethylated DMRs at enhancer chromatin in myoblasts were bound by MYOD much more frequently than by CTCF. Combined with previous studies, our results suggest a more prevalent role for MYOD than for CTCF in organizing transcription-enhancing chromatin interactions at hypomethylated regions. We also found that myoblast-hypomethylated enhancer chromatin enriched in H3K36me3 was much more likely to be associated with genes preferentially expressed in myoblasts than were such regions without H3K36me3 enrichment. Therefore, there may be a special role in gene upregulation for the regional combination of DNA hypomethylation with H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K36me3 enrichment. The unusual relationships between epigenetics and gene expression that we observed need further study in the SkM lineage to better understand fine-tuning of muscle differentiation and diseases.",

Cell cultures had been carefully generated and passaged in collaboration with Rabi Tawil (Tsumagari et al., 2011). Each batch of myoblasts used for DNA methylation analysis was checked for >90% purity by desmin immunostaining because fibroblast-like contaminating cells can easily outgrow myoblasts and give misleading methylome results (Chandra et al. 2015). WGBS was performed on CM3 using standard protocols (Chen F, Zhang G, et al. 2016). Methylation profiling of CM3, CM1, and CM6 was done using enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) (Vaisvila et al. 2021). This process involved enzymatic oxidation of 5mC and 5hmC (by TET2), providing protection from further deamination by APOBEC3A while unmethylated cytosine are deaminated to uracil. Briefly, 0.2 \u00b5g of DNA was used to prepare EM-seq libraries in duplicate. The libraries were then cleaned using NEBNext\u00ae sample selection beads, pooled, and diluted to 1.5 nM for sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000(Illumina)."

As DNA methylation is more conserved across species than across tissues, and as ancient DNA is typically extracted from bones and teeth, previous works utilizing ancient DNA methylation maps focused on studying evolutionary changes in the skeletal system. Here, we suggest that DNA methylation patterns in one tissue may, under certain conditions, be informative on DNA methylation patterns in other tissues of the same individual. Using the fact that tissue- specific DNA methylation builds up during embryonic development, we identified the conditions that allow for such cross-tissue inference and devised an algorithm that carries it out. We trained the algorithm on methylation data from extant species and reached high precisions of up to 0.92 for validation data sets. We then used the algorithm on archaic humans, and identified more than 1,850 positions for which we were able to observe differential DNA methylation in prefrontal cortex neurons. These positions are linked to hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in neural functions such as structural and developmental processes. Six positions are located in the NBPF gene family, which likely played a role in human brain evolution. The algorithm we present here allows for the examination of epigenetic changes in tissues and cell types that are absent from the paleontological record, and therefore provides new ways to study the evolutionary impacts of epigenetic changes.",
