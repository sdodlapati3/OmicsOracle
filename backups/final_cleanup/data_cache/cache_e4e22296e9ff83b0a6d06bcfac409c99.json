This study investigates transcriptional signatures associated with thrombosis development in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and evaluates their predictive potential.",

            "overview": "The dataset GSE300129 addresses the biological question of how gene expression profiles differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic critically ill COVID-19 patients, focusing on the underlying mechanisms of hypercoagulability. Utilizing whole blood gene expression analysis from 112 ICU patients, the study identifies transcriptional signatures that may predict thrombosis risk in this population. This data is valuable for COVID-19 research as it enhances our understanding of thrombotic complications associated with the disease, potentially guiding therapeutic strategies and risk assessment in critically ill patients.",
            "brief": "The dataset GSE300129 explores the transcriptional signatures associated with thrombotic events in critically ill COVID-19 patients, addressing the biological question of how hypercoagulability manifests at the gene expression level. Utilizing whole blood gene expression profiling from 112 patients, the study aims to identify predictive biomarkers for thrombosis, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19-related coagulopathy and potential therapeutic targets for managing thrombotic complications in ICU settings."

In brief, 77 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU with ARDS were included in a biobank study (CIUM). If indicated by clinician, patients underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, which was subsequently repeated 7 days after admission, or if the patient\u2019s clinical condition abruptly deteriorated. Whole blood samples were available from 57 subjects at day 2 of ICU admission and were used in the presented research. Healthy controls were obtained from convalescent subjects enrolled as part of the MERMAIDS-ARI clinical observational study and were matched with cases based on age, gender, pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic disease infromation."
