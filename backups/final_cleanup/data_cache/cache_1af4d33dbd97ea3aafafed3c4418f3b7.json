        "title": "Novel enzyme-based reduced representation method for DNA methylation profiling with low inputs",
        "abstract": "DNA methylation at cytosine-phospho-guanine (CpG) residues is a vital biological process that regulates cell identity and function. Although widely used, bisulfite-based cytosine conversion procedures for DNA methylation sequencing require high temperature and extreme pH, which leads to DNA degradation, especially among unmethylated cytosines. This disproportionate damage to unmethylated cytosines contributes to inaccuracies in GC content representation. EM-seq, an enzyme-based cytosine conversion method, has been proposed as a less biased alternative to methylation profiling. Compared to bisulfite-based methods, EM-seq boasts greater genome coverage with less GC bias and has the potential to cover more CpGs with the same number of reads (i.e., higher signal-to-noise ratio). Reduced representation approaches enrich samples for CpG-rich genomic regions, thereby enhancing throughput and cost effectiveness. We hypothesized that enzyme-based technology could be adapted for reduced representation methylation sequencing to enable high-resolution DNA methylation profiling on low inputs samples. We leveraged the well-established differences in methylation profile between mouse CD4+ T cell populations to compare reduced representation EM-seq (RREM-seq) performance against our previously published modified reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (mRRBS). While the mRRBS method failed to generate reliable DNA libraries when using <2-ng inputs (equivalent to DNA from around 350 cells), the RREM-seq method successfully generated DNA libraries from 1\u201325 ng of mouse and human genomic DNA. These libraries fell within the expected size range, and primer contamination was not observed. Low-input (<2-ng) RREM-seq libraries\u2019 final concentration, regulatory genomic element coverage, and methylation status within the lineage-defining Treg cell-specific super-enhancers were comparable to mRRBS libraries with more than 10-fold higher DNA input. RREM-seq libraries also successfully detected the methylation differences between alveolar Tconv and Treg cells in mechanically ventilated patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Our results suggest that the RREM-seq method can generate reliable libraries for single-nucleotide resolution methylation profiling using low input clinical samples.",

        "abstract": "Around 20-30% of Thyroid cancers are difficult to accurately diagnose with fine needle aspiration (FNA) due to their shared features with benign nodules. Although there are molecular tools to assist the diagnosis, such as the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier and ThyroSeqv3, which are the most widely used in the United States, however, these tests all show low positive predictive value and would lead to unnecessary removal of the thyroid in non-cancer patients. In addition, the prediction model of these tests is trained mainly based on the American population. Therefore, it is required to develop a highly accurate test for thyroid nodule diagnostic which could not only increase the PPV, and reduce the unnecessary surgeries, but also is based on Chinese population datasets. To overcome the potential overfitting issues of the prediction model, here we provide a function-guided DNA methylation biomarker selection method through multi-omics datasets. To develop a novel DNA methylation based diagnostic test for thyroid cancer, we characterized the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in 49 malignant and benign fresh thyroid tissues by using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) analysis on a single nucleotide level. And we found a group of differentiated DNA methylation sites that could be used to distinguish thyroid cancer and benign tissues.",

Despite their significance, the epigenetic basis of human tissue-Treg cells, their differentiation as well as a migratory subset of tissue-Treg cells are incompletely understood. Here, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human Treg cells from skin and blood and integrated these data into a multi-omic framework including chromatin accessibility and gene expression. This analysis revealed novel programs governing human skin Treg cell differentiation and delineated the presence of these programs across molecular levels. We discovered that subfamilies of transposable elements are a major constituent of the hypomethylated landscape of tissue-Treg cells. Based on DNA hypomethylation homologies, our data unveil that the population of blood CCR8+ Treg cells contains recirculating human skin Treg cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the biology of human tissue-Treg cells, which are essential to harness these cells for therapeutic purposes.

        "abstract": "Female human induced pluripotent stem cells frequently undergo X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) erosion, marked by XIST RNA loss and partial reactivation of the inactive X (Xi). This overlooked phenomenon limits our understanding of its impact on stem cell applications. Here, we show that XCI erosion is frequent and heterogeneous, leading to the reactivation of several X-linked genes. These are primarily located on the short arm of the X chromosome, particularly near escape genes and within H3K27me3-enriched domains, with reactivation linked to reduced promoter DNA methylation. Interestingly, escape genes further increase their expression from Xi upon XCI erosion, highlighting the critical role of XIST in their dosage regulation. Importantly, global (hydroxy)methylation levels and imprinted regions remain unaffected, and analysis of trilineage commitment and cardiomyocyte formation reveals that XCI erosion persists across differentiation. These findings underscore the need for greater awareness of the implications of XCI erosion for stem cell research and clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal blood disorder linked to mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. To understand the epigenetic effects of these mutations, we analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of PMF patients. Notably, no differences were found between JAK2 and CALR mutated cases, whereas MPL mutations showed distinct DNAm patterns. Further investigation in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models with JAK2 mutations revealed only a moderate link to PMF-related epigenetic changes, suggesting these alterations are not directly caused by the mutations. Additionally, PMF-associated epigenetic changes showed minimal correlation with allele burden and were largely evoked by changes in the cellular composition. When comparing PMF DNAm profiles with those from other myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome, many overlapping changes were found, making it difficult to distinguish PMF based on individual CpGs. However, a PMF score created by combining five CpGs successfully differentiated PMF from other diseases in training and validation datasets. These findings demonstrate that PMF driver mutations do not directly evoke epigenetic changes. While PMF shares epigenetic changes with other myeloid malignancies, epigenetic signatures can effectively differentiate PMF from related diseases.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondria regulate T cell functions and response to cancer immunotherapy. We show that pharmacologically induced PKM2 activation enhances mitochondria-dependent effector functions in mouse and human CD8 T cells and CAR-T cells. Multi-omics analysis and 13C-glucose tracer experiments showed that PKM2 activation alters one-carbon metabolism with decreased levels of methionine leading to hypomethylation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and enhanced expression of genes supporting mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory complex formation in CD8 T cells. Functionally, PKM2 activation increased the recall responses and anti-tumor functions of CD8 T cells after adoptive cell therapy. Using preclinical melanoma and colon cancer models, we found that PKM2-agonist induced CD8 T cell-dependent anti-tumor responses that synergized with PD1 blockade therapy. Immunologically, PKM2 agonists resulted in enhanced activation and decreased exhaustion of effector T cells while reducing the numbers of suppressive FoxP3+ Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment. Anti-PD1 combination further enhanced the frequency and activation of tumor specific CD8 T cells in the tumors. Together, we show that PKM2 agonism modulates mitochondrial structure and function, leading to enhanced effector functions of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Hence, targeting PKM2 via pharmacologically available small molecules can be a clinically viable strategy for the enhancement of therapeutic potential of in-situ immune responses, adoptive cell therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade therapy",
