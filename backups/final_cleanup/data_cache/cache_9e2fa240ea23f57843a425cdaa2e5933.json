In brief, 77 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU with ARDS were included in a biobank study (CIUM). If indicated by clinician, patients underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, which was subsequently repeated 7 days after admission, or if the patient\u2019s clinical condition abruptly deteriorated. Whole blood samples were available from 57 subjects at day 2 of ICU admission and were used in the presented research. Healthy controls were obtained from convalescent subjects enrolled as part of the MERMAIDS-ARI clinical observational study and were matched with cases based on age, gender, pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic disease infromation."

        "abstract": "Advanced age is the most important risk factor for severe or even lethal COVID-19, but a thorough understanding of the underlying differences in infection-induced inflammation and cellular pathogenesis is missing. In samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients aged 1 to 84 years, we observed a continuous rewiring of type I interferon signaling and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) usage across monocytes, CD4+ T cells and B cells during aging. In vitro investigations using cells from controls confirmed this as a general age-induced phenomenon. Conversion in interferon signaling from STAT1 to STAT3 was associated with increased inflammatory profiles, cytokine release and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells. A shift from solely interferon-responsive germinal center B (GCB) cells towards CD69high GCB and atypical B cells was linked to formation of IgA in children vs complement fixing IgG in adults. Our data provide molecular explanations for inflammation-prone responses to infections during aging.",

PBMCs were isolated and a part of the PBMCs from each donor was enriched for B cells. Total PBMCs and enriched B cells were subjected to 5' GEX scRNAseq and 5' VDJ library preparation. Samples were pooled with Antibody-based Hashtags and demultiplexed based on both Hashtags and SNPs. Sample groups included are : uninfected children (median age = 7), uninfected adults (median age = 66), infected children (median age = 9; asymptomatic n = 5, symptomatic n = 8) and infected adults (median age = 67; mild n = 5, severe n = 7, severe with IFN autoantibodies n = 7)."

        "abstract": "Severe pneumonia by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 infection) is mediated through immune dysregulation. It was studied if this dysregulation persists after recovery and if it is linked to the manifestation of post-covid syndrome (PCS). Patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia 3 to 6 months ago during two different time periods and matched comparators were the derivation cohort (n=46, September-October 2020) and the validation cohort (n=484, April-July 2021) respectively. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for culture and cytokine stimulation. Patients provided answers to two health questionnaires allowing classification into PCS and were also subject to lung function tests (LFT). The primary endpoint was the modulation of the production of interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 from monocytes and among secondary, the modulation of adaptive immune response and the development of PCS. Increased production of IL-1b (p<0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.001) was found in both study periods compared to control. There was increase of pro-inflammatory Th1 responses over anti-inflammatory Th2 responses and attenuation of the T17 response. PCS was manifested in 22% of patients, grouped into three groups of symptoms. Fatigue was associated with the predominance of Th2 responses and abnormal LFT with overproduction of IL-1b and IL-6. Immune dysregulation is apparent after three months post COVID-19 pneumonia with main features the hyper-production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 by circulating monocytes, the increase of the Th1/Th2 ratio and the attenuation of T17 response.",
