        "abstract": "The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection mostly represented by asymptomatic or mild, however a small but relevant proportion of patients develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by an excessive, host immune response with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can rapidly lead to multi-organ failure and death. Indeed, immune pathologies are well characterised through deep immune phenotyping, plasma analysis, sc-RNA and chip based methylation analysis, still we lack a molecular understanding of immune pathologies associated with COVID-19 which is urgently needed for new prognostic and therapeutic interventions. In this study, we first time showed a SARS-Cov2 induced severity associated deregulation of immune functions driven through a global reprogramming of immune functions through a epigenetically driven gene regulatory network",

        "title": "Plasma proteomics and organ dysfunction in COVID-19 ARDS",
        "abstract": "Fatal COVID-19 is often complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanisms governing lung injury and repair in ARDS remain poorly understood because there are no biomarker-targeted therapeutics for patients with ARDS. We hypothesized that plasma proteomics may uncover unique biomarkers that correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 ARDS. We analyzed the circulating plasma proteome from 32 patients with ARDS and COVID-19 using an aptamer-based platform, which measures 7289 proteins, and correlated protein measurements with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores at 2 time points (Days 1 and 7 following ICU admission). We compared differential protein abundance and SOFA scores at each individual time point and identified 119 proteins at Day 1 and 46 proteins at Day 7 that correlated with patient SOFA scores. We modeled the relationship between dynamic protein abundance and changes in SOFA score between Days 1 and 7 and identified 39 proteins that significantly correlated with changes in SOFA score. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified increased ephrin signaling and acute phase response signaling correlated with increased SOFA scores over time, while pathways related to pulmonary fibrosis signaling and wound healing had an inverse relationship with SOFA scores between Days 1 and 7. These findings suggest that persistent inflammation may drive worsened disease severity, while repair processes correlate with improvements in organ dysfunction over time. This approach is generalizable to more diverse ARDS cohorts for identification of protein biomarkers and disease mechanisms as we strive towards targeted therapies in ARDS.",

        "abstract": "Despite their remarkable success, the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is notably diminished in organ transplant patients. Here, we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the immunological state at baseline and following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination of lung transplant (LTX) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Our analysis revealed a baseline immune profile in LTX patients that mirrors the immune alterations observed in severe COVID-19 cases and sepsis. This profile is characterized by: (i) elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma, notably high levels of EN-RAGE and IL-6; (ii) reduced expression of HLA-DR on blood monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs); (iii) diminished cytokine production by blood monocytes and DCs in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) activation; (iv) increased plasma concentrations of microbial products. In addition to these alterations, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed 4 transcriptionally distinct clusters of classical monocytes in HC, with a striking enrichment of a unique classical monocyte cluster in LTX patients, differing from the predominant classical monocytes in HC, marked by heightened expression of the S100A family and reduced expression of genes related to cytokine production and antigen presentation. Following vaccination, LTX patients displayed a reduced magnitude and breadth of binding and neutralizing antibody responses, and impaired memory B and T cell responses. Furthermore, there was a blunted innate immune response to vaccination, evidenced by decreased transcriptional signatures linked to antigen presentation, dendritic cell activation, interferon and monocytes at the single-cell level. Integrative multiscale, multiresponse network (MMRN) analysis revealed an inverse correlation between the distinctive baseline immunological state observed in LTX patients and the adaptive immune responses to vaccines. These findings underscore the distinct immunological profile of lung transplant recipients, providing insights into their immunosuppressed condition and reduced immune responses to vaccines.",
