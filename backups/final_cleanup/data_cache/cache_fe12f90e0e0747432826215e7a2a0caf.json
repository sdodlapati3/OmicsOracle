        "abstract": "The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection mostly represented by asymptomatic or mild, however a small but relevant proportion of patients develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by an excessive, host immune response with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can rapidly lead to multi-organ failure and death. Indeed, immune pathologies are well characterised through deep immune phenotyping, plasma analysis, sc-RNA and chip based methylation analysis, still we lack a molecular understanding of immune pathologies associated with COVID-19 which is urgently needed for new prognostic and therapeutic interventions. In this study, we first time showed a SARS-Cov2 induced severity associated deregulation of immune functions driven through a global reprogramming of immune functions through a epigenetically driven gene regulatory network",

            "overview": "The dataset GSE202805 addresses the biological question of how SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to severe immune dysregulation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to convalescent individuals. Using global transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 80 patients, the study identifies key gene expression changes associated with the severity of COVID-19, thereby enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immune pathologies in this disease. This data is valuable for researchers seeking to develop prognostic markers and therapeutic strategies, as it provides insights into the immune response dynamics during severe COVID-19, which is critical for improving patient outcomes.",
            "brief": "The dataset GSE202805 investigates the transcriptomic alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with severe COVID-19 and convalescents, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune dysregulation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Utilizing global transcriptomic analysis on a cohort of 80 samples, this study provides critical insights into the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could inform future prognostic and treatment strategies for COVID-19, thereby addressing a significant gap in understanding the disease's severe manifestations."
