        "title": "Spatiotemporal organisation of residual disease in mouse and human BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and breast cancer",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer remains one of the prominent causes of death worldwide. Although chemotherapeutic agents often result in substantial reduction of primary or metastatic tumors, remaining drug-tolerant tumor cell populations, known as minimal residual disease (MRD), pose a significant risk of recurrence and therapy resistance. In this study, we describe the spatiotemporal organisation of therapy response and MRD in BRCA1;p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors and human clinical samples using a multimodal approach. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and imaging mass cytometry across multiple treatment timepoints, we characterise dynamic interactions between tumor cell subpopulations and their surrounding microenvironment. Our analysis identifies a distinct, drug-tolerant epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cancer cell population, which exhibits a conserved expression program in human BRCA1-deficient tumors and significantly correlates with adverse clinical outcomes. We further reveal the spatial distribution of residual EMT-like tumor cells within specific anatomical niches, providing a framework for understanding the persistence of MRD and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. These findings yield a comprehensive molecular roadmap of MRD, opening new avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting EMT-driven drug tolerance and tumor relapse.",

          "overall_design": "Spatial transcriptomics: Mammary tumors derived from the K14cre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse model were transplanted into the fourth mammary fat pad of syngeneic FVB/NJ mice. To minimise genetic variability, all tumors originated from two parental tumors that were subdivided before transplantation. Tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed at baseline or treated with a single dose of cisplatin or TAC therapy (doxorubicin, docetaxel, and cyclophosphamide). Spatial transcriptomics (ST) was applied to primary (n = 10), residual (n = 16), recurrent (n = 4) tumor sections, and healthy mammary glands (n = 2), (total n = 32). Residual tumors were collected at 7 (TAC: n = 2, Cisplatin: n = 2) or 12 days (TAC: n = 4, Cisplatin: n = 3) post-treatment. Recurrent tumors were harvested upon regrowth (TAC: n = 2, Cisplatin: n = 2). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the canton of Bern (Switzerland) and are in accordance with the current Swiss Acts on Animal Experimentation. Additionally, tumor samples from five women carrying germline BRCA1 mutations were collected at surgery. ST was performed on primary (n = 2) and residual (n = 3) tumors (after neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Patients were treated at Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland. The study was approved by the local ethical committee under protocol CCER 2019-00004, and all donors were coded."

        "title": "CD105+ fibroblasts support an immunosuppressive niche in women at high risk of breast cancer initiation",
        "abstract": "Background: Aging is the greatest risk factor for breast cancer, and although epithelial cells are the source of carcinomas, epithelial changes alone do not fully explain cancer susceptibility. Fibroblasts and macrophages are key stromal constituents around the cells of origin for cancer in breast tissue. With age, macrophages surrounding terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs) become increasingly immunosuppressive. CD105+ fibroblasts intercalate within TDLUs, drive luminal differentiation, and give rise to immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts in other tissues. We propose that differences in fibroblasts are a crucial component of the stroma that shapes cancer susceptibility. Methods: Primary fibroblast cultures were established from prophylactic and reduction mammoplasties from women ranging in age from 16 to 70 years and breast cancer risk (BRCA1 mutation carriers). Growth characteristics, transcriptional profiles, differentiation potential, and secreted proteins were profiled for fibroblast subtypes from diverse donors. Co-cultures with fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells were used to ascertain the functional role played by CD105+ fibroblasts in immune cell modulation. Results: We found that peri-epithelial CD105+ fibroblasts are enriched in older women as well as women who carry BRCA1 mutations. These CD105+ fibroblasts exhibit robust adipogenesis and secrete factors related to macrophage polarization. Macrophages cocultured with fibroblasts better maintain or enhance polarization states than media alone. CD105+ fibroblasts increased expression of immunosuppressive macrophage genes. CD105+ fibroblasts supported anti-inflammatory macrophage-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation, whereas CD105\u2212 fibroblasts significantly reduced the suppressive effect of anti-inflammatory macrophages on T cell proliferation. Conclusions: Establishment of a coculture system to dissect the molecular circuits between CD105+ fibroblasts and macrophages that drive immunosuppressive macrophage polarization has broad utility in understanding mammary gland development and events that precede cancer initiation. CD105+ fibroblasts and macrophages may coordinate to suppress immunosurveillance and increase breast cancer susceptibility.",
