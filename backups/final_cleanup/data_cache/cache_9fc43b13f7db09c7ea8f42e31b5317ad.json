        "abstract": "The gene A-kinase anchoring protein 11 (AKAP11) recently emerged as a shared risk factor between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, driven by large-effect loss-of-function (LoF) variants. Recent research has uncovered the neurophysiological characteristics and synapse proteomics profile of Akap11-mutant mouse models. Considering the role of AKAP11 in binding cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and mediating phosphorylation of numerous substrates, such as transcription factors and epigenetic regulators, and given that chromatin alterations have been implicated in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, it is crucial to uncover the transcriptomic and chromatin dysregulations following the heterozygous knockout of AKAP11, particularly in human neurons. In this study, we use genome-wide approaches to investigate such aberrations in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We show the impact of heterozygous AKAP11 LoF mutations on the gene expression landscape and profile the methylomic and acetylomic modifications. Altogether we highlight the involvement of aberrant activity of intergenic and intronic enhancers, which are enriched in PBX homeobox 2 (PBX2) and Nuclear Factor-1 (NF1) known binding motifs, respectively, in transcription dysregulations of genes functioning as DNA-binding transcription factors, actin and cytoskeleton regulators, and cytokine receptors, as well as genes involved in G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) binding and signaling. We also show significant downregulation of pathways related to ribosome structure and function, a pathway also altered in BD and SCZ post-mortem brain tissues and heterozygous Akap11-KO mice synapse proteomics.  A better understanding of the dysregulations resulting from haploinsufficiency in AKAP11 improves our knowledge of the biological roots and pathophysiology of BD and SCZ, paving the way for better therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), no recurrent metastasis-specific mutation has been found, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are the major contributors of late-stage disease progression. Here, we performed the first whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on mouse and human PDAC organoid models to identify stage-specific and subtype-specific DNA methylation signatures in PDAC. With this approach, we identified thousands of DMRs that can distinguish between the stages and subtypes of PDAC. Stage-specific DMRs are associated with genes related to nervous system development and cell-cell adhesions and are enriched in promoters and bivalent enhancers. Subtype-specific DMRs showed hypermethylation of GATA6 transcriptional networks in the squamous subtype and hypermethylation of EMT transcriptional networks in the progenitor subtype. These results indicate that aberrant DNA methylation contributes to both PDAC progression and subtype differentiation, resulting in significant and reoccurring DNA methylation patterns with diagnostic and prognostic potential.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation is tightly regulated during development and is stably maintained in normal cells. In contrast, the methylome of cancer cells is commonly characterized by a global loss of DNA methylation co-occurring with CpG island hypermethylation. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the commonest childhood cancer, perturbations of CpG methylation have been reported to be associated with genetic disease subtype and outcome, but data examining large cohorts at genome-wide scale are lacking. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of leukemic cells across multiple subtypes of ALL, leukemia cell lines and normal hematopoietic cells, and show that in contrast to most cancers, ALL samples only exhibit CpG island hypermethylation but minimal global loss of methylation. This was most pronounced in T-ALL and accompanied by an exceptionally broad range of hypermethylation of CpG islands between patients that is influenced by TET2 and DNMT3B. These findings demonstrate that ALL is characterized by an unusually highly methylated genome, and provide insights into the deregulation of methylation in cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Disruption of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) differentiation is implicated in implicated in distal lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and lung adenocarcinoma that impact morbidity and mortality worldwide. Elucidating underlying disease pathogenesis requires a mechanistic molecular understanding of AEC differentiation. Previous studies have focused on changes of individual transcription factors, and to date no study has comprehensively characterized the dynamic, global epigenomic alterations that facilitate this critical differentiation process in humans. We comprehensively profiled the epigenomic states of human AECs during type 2 to type 1-like cell differentiation, including the methylome and chromatin functional domains, and integrated this with transcriptome-wide RNA expression data.  Enhancer regions were drastically altered during AEC differentiation. Transcription factor binding analysis within enhancer regions revealed diverse interactive networks with enrichment for many transcription factors, including NKX2-1 and FOXA family members, as well as transcription factors with less well characterized roles in AEC differentiation, such as members of the MEF2, TEAD, and AP1 families. Additionally, associations among transcription factors changed during differentiation, implicating a complex network of heterotrimeric complex switching in driving differentiation. Integration of AEC enhancer states with the catalog of enhancer elements in the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) revealed that AECs have similar epigenomic structures to other profiled epithelial cell types, including human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), with NKX2-1 serving as a distinguishing feature of distal lung differentiation. Enhancer regions are hotspots of epigenomic alteration that regulate AEC differentiation. Furthermore, the differentiation process is regulated by dynamic networks of transcription factors acting in concert, rather than individually. These findings provide a roadmap for understanding the relationship between disruption of the epigenetic state during AEC differentiation and development of lung diseases that may be therapeutically amenable.",

        "abstract": "Background: Mapping of allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) can be a post-GWAS strategy for localizing regulatory sequence polymorphisms (rSNPs). However, the advantages of this approach, and the mechanisms underlying ASM in normal and neoplastic cells, remain to be clarified.  Results: We performed whole genome methyl-seq on diverse normal cells and tissues and three types of cancers (multiple myeloma, lymphoma, glioblastoma multiforme). After excluding imprinting, the data pinpointed 15,114 high-confidence ASM differentially methylated regions (DMRs), of which 1,842 contained SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium or coinciding with GWAS peaks. ASM frequencies were increased 5 to 9-fold in cancers vs. matched normal tissues, due to widespread allele-specific hypomethylation and focal allele-specific hypermethylation in poised chromatin. Cancers showed increased allele switching at ASM loci, but destructive SNPs in specific classes of CTCF and transcription factor (TF) binding motifs were similarly correlated with ASM in cancer and non-cancer. Rare somatic mutations in these same motif classes tracked with de novo ASM in the cancers. Allele-specific TF binding from ChIP-seq was enriched among ASM loci, but most ASM DMRs lacked such annotations, and some were found in otherwise uninformative \u201cchromatin deserts\u201d.   Conclusions: ASM is increased in cancers but occurs by a shared mechanism involving rSNPs in CTCF and TF binding sites in normal and neoplastic cells. Dense ASM mapping in normal plus cancer samples reveals candidate rSNPs that are difficult to find by other approaches. Together with GWAS data, these rSNPs can nominate specific transcriptional pathways in susceptibility to autoimmune, neuropsychiatric, and neoplastic diseases.",

The NYGC used a modified Nextera transposase-based library approach. Briefly, genomic DNA was first tagmented using Nextera XT transposome and end repair was performed using 5mC. After bisulfite conversion, Illumina adapters and custom bisulfite converted adapters are attached by limited cycle PCR. Two separate libraries were prepared and pooled for each sample to limit the duplication rate and sequenced using Illumina X system (150 bp paired-end). WGBS performed at MNG used the Illumina TruSeq DNA Methylation Kit for library construction according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and generated 150 bp paired end reads on an Illumina NovaSeq machine. WGBS performed at RPCI utilized the ACCEL-NGS Methyl-Seq DNA Library kit for library construction (Swift Biosciences) and generated 150 bp paired end reads on an Illumina NovaSeq. After trimming for low-quality bases (Phred score<30) and reads with a length <40 bp with TrimGalore, the reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh37) using Bismark with paired end mode and default setting. Duplicate reads were removed using Picard tools and reads with more than 10% unconverted CHG or CHH cytosines were filtered out. SNP calling was performed with BisSNP using default settings, except for the maximum coverage filter set at 200 to encompass deep sequencing, and quality score recalibration. SNP calling was carried out using human genome GRCh37 and dbSNP147 as references. For ASM calling, we filtered out heterozygous SNPs with less than 5 reads per allele. In addition, SNP with multiple mapping positions were filtered out, as well as SNPs with more than one minor allele with allele frequency>0.05 and SNPs that deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on exact tests corrected for multiple tests (FDR<0.05 by HardyWeinberg R package).  C/T and G/A SNPs were assessed after filtering out reads mapping to the C/T strand.   ASM calling was performed after separating the SNP-containing reads by allele. After Bismark methylation extractor is applied, CpG methylation calls by allele are retrieved using allele tagged read IDs. Paired reads with ambiguous SNP calling (i.e., called as REF allele on one paired end and ALT allele on the other) were discarded. For Nextera WGBS, due to the fill-in reaction using 5mC following DNA tagmentation which affects the 10 first base pairs (bp) on 5\u2019 of read 2, methylation calling for Cs mapping to these bp were not considered. In addition, a slight methylation bias due to random priming and specific to each library kit was observed within the last 2 bp on 3\u2019 of both paired ends for Nextera WGBS, within the first 10 bp on 5\u2019 of both paired ends and the last 2 bp on 3\u2019 of read 2 for TruSeq WGBS, and within the first 10 bp on 5\u2019 of read 2 for ACCEL-NGS WGBS. Therefore, methylation calls in these windows were ignored."

Alterations in lncRNAs can lead to the development of diseases such as cancer. However, the role of lncRNAs in resistance to platinum chemotherapy is largely unknown. To screen for epigenetic changes involved in the development of resistance, we combined lncRNA and mRNA expression microarrays with whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in four paired cisplatin-sensitive/resistant cells from non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer. We found low levels of expression changes in lncRNAs (1.5%) and mRNAs (2%) when comparing resistant vs. sensitive cells. The correlation between lncRNA/mRNA arrays and WGBS identified two groups of lncRNAs, classified according to their relationship with the gene they have in silico complementarity or with their possible epigenetic regulation at the DNA methylation level. Validation of the results of expression and methylation levels allowed us to characterize lncRNAs in cisplatin-resistant phenotypes. In this study, we characterized lncRNAs that change in cisplatin-resistant cells due to epigenetic regulation at the DNA methylation level and the associated changes in expression levels. We have identified two groups of differentially expressed and methylated lncRNAs, indicating a new approach to the study of the mechanisms involved in the development of acquired resistance to cisplatin in cancer cells.",
