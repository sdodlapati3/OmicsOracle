This study investigates transcriptional signatures associated with thrombosis development in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and evaluates their predictive potential.",

Utilizing whole blood gene expression analysis from 112 ICU patients, the study identifies transcriptional signatures that may predict thrombosis risk in this population. This data is valuable for COVID-19 research as it enhances our understanding of thrombotic complications associated with the disease, potentially guiding therapeutic strategies and risk assessment in critically ill patients.",

Utilizing whole blood gene expression profiling from 112 patients, the study aims to identify predictive biomarkers for thrombosis, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19-related coagulopathy and potential therapeutic targets for managing thrombotic complications in ICU settings."

In brief, 77 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU with ARDS were included in a biobank study (CIUM). If indicated by clinician, patients underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, which was subsequently repeated 7 days after admission, or if the patient\u2019s clinical condition abruptly deteriorated. Whole blood samples were available from 57 subjects at day 2 of ICU admission and were used in the presented research. Healthy controls were obtained from convalescent subjects enrolled as part of the MERMAIDS-ARI clinical observational study and were matched with cases based on age, gender, pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic disease infromation."

        "abstract": "Advanced age is the most important risk factor for severe or even lethal COVID-19, but a thorough understanding of the underlying differences in infection-induced inflammation and cellular pathogenesis is missing. In samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients aged 1 to 84 years, we observed a continuous rewiring of type I interferon signaling and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) usage across monocytes, CD4+ T cells and B cells during aging. In vitro investigations using cells from controls confirmed this as a general age-induced phenomenon. Conversion in interferon signaling from STAT1 to STAT3 was associated with increased inflammatory profiles, cytokine release and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells. A shift from solely interferon-responsive germinal center B (GCB) cells towards CD69high GCB and atypical B cells was linked to formation of IgA in children vs complement fixing IgG in adults. Our data provide molecular explanations for inflammation-prone responses to infections during aging.",

PBMCs were isolated and a part of the PBMCs from each donor was enriched for B cells. Total PBMCs and enriched B cells were subjected to 5' GEX scRNAseq and 5' VDJ library preparation. Samples were pooled with Antibody-based Hashtags and demultiplexed based on both Hashtags and SNPs. Sample groups included are : uninfected children (median age = 7), uninfected adults (median age = 66), infected children (median age = 9; asymptomatic n = 5, symptomatic n = 8) and infected adults (median age = 67; mild n = 5, severe n = 7, severe with IFN autoantibodies n = 7)."
