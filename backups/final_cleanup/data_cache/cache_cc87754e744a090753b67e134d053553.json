        "abstract": "The T cell-intrinsic element that responds to tumor microenvironment (TME) stress to shape CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) fate and function in solid cancers remains elusive. Here we report that the hypoxic TME imprints persistent activity of the central transcriptional node of the integrated stress response (ISR), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), in CD8+ TILs that results in metabolic polarity, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and cell death. Chronic ATF4 expression replicated the terminal exhaustion cell state in CD8+ T cells and high Atf4 expression in bulk tumor or peripheral T cells of patients with melanoma predicted poor response to PD-1 inhibition. Genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of ATF4 reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and promoted viability among CD8+ TILs, enabling complete responses to PD-1 inhibition and conferring protection from re-emergent disease. Our multidisciplinary approach identifies chronic ATF4 activity as a barrier to immune checkpoint inhibitors, positioning ISR therapeutics as novel treatment strategies to improve efficacy of immunotherapy combinations.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-therapy has received FDA approval for the treatment of advanced melanoma and shows potential for broader applications in solid tumors, including glioblastoma. In this study, tumor-reactive TILs (tr-TILs) are isolated and enriched for CD137 expression from cavitron ultrasonic aspirator (CUSA) emulsions of 161 adult patients diagnosed with diffuse gliomas. Tr-TILs are successfully expanded in 87 out of the 161 patients, reflecting an expansion rate of 54%. Notably, the presence of IDH1 mutation and the cumulative dose of steroids are identified as significant negative predictors of expansion efficacy. The expanded tr-TILs exhibit distinct phenotypic and molecular dysfunctional features yet show upregulated expression of progenitor/memory-like markers and polyclonal T-cell receptors. Importantly, these tr-TILs demonstrate specific antitumor reactivity against autologous tumor cells in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. These findings provide a compelling background for a personalized immunotherapeutic approach while tackling one of the most significant challenges in oncology.",

        "title": "TrAEL-seq captures DNA replication dynamics in mammalian cells",
        "abstract": "Precise DNA replication is critical to the maintenance of genome stability, and the DNA replication machinery is a focal point of many current and upcoming chemotherapeutics. TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples, and does not require cell synchronisation, drug treatment, labelling or sorting. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication initiation zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb).  Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first ~1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced initiation zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are major immune components of the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor growth and limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy in almost all cancer indications. While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGF\u03b2-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGF\u03b2 expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.",

Here, we created an Integrated Single-cell Kidney Atlas including over one million cells from 140 samples, defining more than 70 conserved cell states in human and rodent models. We developed CellSpectra, a computational tool that quantifies changes in gene expression coordination across cellular functions, which we applied to kidney and lung cancer data. This tool powers our Patient-Level Single-Cell Functional Profiling Report, which highlights cell-type-specific changes in pathway gene expression coordination in individuals. Our cross-species atlas facilitates the selection of a rodent model that closely reflects the cellular and pathway-level signatures observed in a patient sample, advancing the application of single-cell methodologies in clinical precision medicine. Finally, by using experimental models, we demonstrate how our informatics approach can be applied for the potential selection of suitable therapeutics.",
