              "summary": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism is dysregulated in diabetic retinopathy. Retina M\u00fcller cells maintain various metabolic processes and immune homeostasis. Here, we found that branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), which catalyzes the first step of BCAAs metabolism, was predominantly expressed in retina M\u00fcller cells. Under diabetic conditions, BCAT1 showed increased enzymatic activity in M\u00fcller cells, which drove the remodeling of BCAAs catabolism, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Mechanistically, BCAT1 activity was negatively regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) via phosphorylation at threonine 333. Increased BCAT1 activity further reduced \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels, a critical substrate for histone demethylation, resulting in higher H3K4me3 levels at inflammatory gene promoters, and further upregulated inflammation genes. Treatment with chemical BCAT inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory gene expression and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas in vivo. These findings reveal a crucial role of BCAT1 in metabolic remodeling and inflammatory regulation, which indicates that BCAT1 could be used as a target for diabetic retinopathy.",

              "summary": "Cytokine-stimulated transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes is linked to the development of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Inhibitors of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) epigenetic reader proteins attenuate inflammatory gene transcription and delay the onset of several inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diabetes. Our previous studies showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors disrupt the interaction between BET family member BRD4 and NF-\u03baB transcription factor p65 in \u03b2-cells, thus attenuating cytokine-stimulated NF-\u03baB-dependent gene and functional changes. However, the role of NF-\u03baB in developing inflammatory disease is controversial, as NF-\u03baB inhibition can promote disease progression in some contexts. NF-\u03baB target genes play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in regulating the cellular response to cytokines. Here, using cytokine-stimulated pancreatic \u03b2-cells as an inflammatory disease model, we show that NF-\u03baB-dependent gene products that participate in inflammation are sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. In contrast, gene products that maintain cellular homeostasis or protect \u03b2-cells from stressors are largely insensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. These studies define a novel and selective role for BET bromodomain-containing proteins in regulating inflammatory gene activation.",

Integration of ST with public single-cell RNA sequencing data enabled interrogation of transcriptional alterations in T1D across both tissues at the cellular scale. In the T1D pancreas, we identified global upregulation of inflammation-associated transcripts, including multiple regenerating islet-derived (REG) family genes, complement factor 3 (C3), SOD2, and OLFM4, and highlighted cellular candidates potentially contributing to these signatures. Within the T1D pLN, we observed spatially restricted upregulation of lymphotoxin-\uf062 (LTB) alongside follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-associated transcripts including FDCSP, CLU, and FCER2. Collectively, these findings highlight a distinct inflammation signature in the pancreas and evidence of enhanced follicular activity in the associated pLN.",

              "summary": "Placental ageing refers to the physiological accumulation of a senescent phenotype over healthy pregnancy. In pregnancies affected by complications such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, placental ageing is notably accelerated and observed at an earlier gestational age. Metformin is used during pregnancy for an increasing variety of indications, including treatment of gestational diabetes and may have a role in slowing cellular ageing. It is therefore essential to understand the potential impact of metformin on placental ageing. Placental samples (n=105) were obtained from women with BMI \u226530kg/m2 randomised to treatment with metformin or placebo during pregnancy. Ageing was assessed by measuring telomere length, histological examination, and using array-based technologies to investigate gene expression and methylation. Results were validated using isolated human trophoblasts treated in vitro with metformin, and in a complementary mouse model. There were no differences between metformin-exposed and control placentas in terms of telomere length, fibrosis, or calcification. There were no differences in placental gene expression or methylation patterns by metformin status. In our mouse model, no genes classically associated with cellular ageing were differentially expressed and no senescence pathway showed evidence of enrichment with metformin treatment. There was no evidence that metformin either slows or accelerates placental ageing pathways in the complementary models that we investigated. Our findings are reassuring with regards to the safety of metformin used to treat gestational diabetes, but do not support a role for metformin in the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes in non-diabetic women.",
              "overall_design": "Wild-type C57BL/6J mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories were bred in house. Female mice were ad libitum fed a well-established obesogenic diet (no. 824053, Special Dietary Services) (Fernandez-Twinn et al., 2012) supplemented with condensed milk (no. 12029969, Nestl\u00e9) from weaning (3 weeks of age). A first pregnancy was commenced at 6 weeks of age, and mating for the second pregnancy was commenced when the mice achieved a body weight of \u226535g (~18 weeks of age). The day of the plug was considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5) and fetuses were culled at E18.5. Mice were randomized to receive metformin (0215169-CF, MP Biomedicals) in the condensed milk one week before mating and throughout the subsequent pregnancy to a dose of 300mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1.7g in a 70kg man) (Salom\u00e4ki et al., 2014). We calculated that a sample size of 12 per group would be sufficiently powered to detect differential gene expression using a log 2-fold change of 1, mean coefficient of variation of 0.4 and mean depth of coverage of 50. 35-45mg of placental tissue was isolated from 12 control and 12 metformin treated placentas. RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN), with DNA contamination removed using the DNAse kit (QIAGEN). Both steps were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA quality and concentration was assessed by nanodrop analysis. RNA integrity (RIN) of > 8 for all samples was confirmed by analysis with the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 system (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit). 400ng of total RNA was used for library construction (TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Pre Kit; Illumina). Indexed libraries were normalized, pooled and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (50bp paired-end).",

              "summary": "Under feeding conditions, increases in circulating glucose concentrations trigger the release of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell viability in part via triggering of the beta cell GLP-1 receptor and subsequent induction of the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of CREB and induction of CREB target genes. By contrast with the acute effects of this pathway on immediate early CREB target genes, which attenuate the cAMP-CREB response, sustained exposure of beta cells to GLP-1 agonist (exenatide-4; Ex-4) or adenyl cyclase activator (Forskolin; FSK) stimulates the expression of beta cell specific CREB target genes with delayed kinetics. In a proteomic screen for transcriptional co-regulators that mediate the long-term effects of GLP-1, we identified Med14, a backbone subunit of the Mediator complex. Exposure to either Ex-4 or FSK stimulates Med14 phosphorylation at Ser983, corresponding to a conserved PKA recognition site (RRXS) that is located within an intrinsically disordered region of Med14. Phosphorylation of Med14 is essential for maintenance of enhancers that drive induction of beta cell-specific and diabetes-linked genes.  Mutation of Med14 at Ser983 to alanine decreased beta cell numbers and repressed growth factor signaling in primary mouse islets. Our work reveals how phosphorylation of a general transcription factor in response to GLP-1 analogs triggers a broad genomic response with salutary effects on beta cell function.",

              "summary": "T cell-mediated islet destruction is a hallmark of autoimmune diabetes. Here, we examined the dynamics and pathogenicity of CD4+ T cell responses to four different insulin-derived epitopes during diabetes initiation in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tetramer-sorted CD4+ T cells from the pancreas revealed that islet-antigen-specific T cells adopted a wide variety of fates and required XCR1+ dendritic cells for their activation. Hybrid-insulin C-chromogranin A (InsC-ChgA)-specific CD4+ T cells skewed toward a distinct Th1 (T helper type 1) effector phenotype, whereas the majority of insulin B chain and hybrid-insulin C-islet amyloid polypeptide-specific CD4+ T exhibited a regulatory T cell phenotype and early or weak Th1 phenotype, respectively. InsC-ChgA-specific CD4+ T cells were uniquely pathogenic upon transfer, and an anti-InsC-ChgA:IAg7 antibody prevented spontaneous diabetes. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of T cell responses to insulin-derived epitopes in diabetes and argue for the feasibility of antigen-specific therapies that blunts the response of pathogenic CD4+ T cells causing autoimmunity.",

The RNA from tetramer-bound single-cells was then sequenced and cells from individual mice were identified using hashtag oligonucleotides, and antigen-specific cells were identified using unique oligonucleotide tags specific for each tetramer. The data were were analysed for gene expression levels and tetramer positivity. The dataset contains 13 HTO (mouse specific) tags and 4 TET (tetramer specific) tags.",

Here, we found that branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), which catalyzes the first step of BCAAs metabolism, was predominantly expressed in retina M\u00fcller cells. Under diabetic conditions, BCAT1 showed increased enzymatic activity in M\u00fcller cells, which drove the remodeling of BCAAs catabolism, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Mechanistically, BCAT1 activity was negatively regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) via phosphorylation at threonine 333. Increased BCAT1 activity further reduced \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels, a critical substrate for histone demethylation, resulting in higher H3K4me3 levels at inflammatory gene promoters, and further upregulated inflammation genes. Treatment with chemical BCAT inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory gene expression and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas in vivo.

Inhibitors of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) epigenetic reader proteins attenuate inflammatory gene transcription and delay the onset of several inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diabetes.

However, the role of NF-\u03baB in developing inflammatory disease is controversial, as NF-\u03baB inhibition can promote disease progression in some contexts. NF-\u03baB target genes play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in regulating the cellular response to cytokines. Here, using cytokine-stimulated pancreatic \u03b2-cells as an inflammatory disease model, we show that NF-\u03baB-dependent gene products that participate in inflammation are sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition.

          "summary": "Placental ageing refers to the physiological accumulation of a senescent phenotype over healthy pregnancy. In pregnancies affected by complications such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, placental ageing is notably accelerated and observed at an earlier gestational age. Metformin is used during pregnancy for an increasing variety of indications, including treatment of gestational diabetes and may have a role in slowing cellular ageing. It is therefore essential to understand the potential impact of metformin on placental ageing. Placental samples (n=105) were obtained from women with BMI \u226530kg/m2 randomised to treatment with metformin or placebo during pregnancy. Ageing was assessed by measuring telomere length, histological examination, and using array-based technologies to investigate gene expression and methylation. Results were validated using isolated human trophoblasts treated in vitro with metformin, and in a complementary mouse model. There were no differences between metformin-exposed and control placentas in terms of telomere length, fibrosis, or calcification. There were no differences in placental gene expression or methylation patterns by metformin status. In our mouse model, no genes classically associated with cellular ageing were differentially expressed and no senescence pathway showed evidence of enrichment with metformin treatment. There was no evidence that metformin either slows or accelerates placental ageing pathways in the complementary models that we investigated. Our findings are reassuring with regards to the safety of metformin used to treat gestational diabetes, but do not support a role for metformin in the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes in non-diabetic women.",

          "summary": "Under feeding conditions, increases in circulating glucose concentrations trigger the release of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell viability in part via triggering of the beta cell GLP-1 receptor and subsequent induction of the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of CREB and induction of CREB target genes. By contrast with the acute effects of this pathway on immediate early CREB target genes, which attenuate the cAMP-CREB response, sustained exposure of beta cells to GLP-1 agonist (exenatide-4; Ex-4) or adenyl cyclase activator (Forskolin; FSK) stimulates the expression of beta cell specific CREB target genes with delayed kinetics. In a proteomic screen for transcriptional co-regulators that mediate the long-term effects of GLP-1, we identified Med14, a backbone subunit of the Mediator complex. Exposure to either Ex-4 or FSK stimulates Med14 phosphorylation at Ser983, corresponding to a conserved PKA recognition site (RRXS) that is located within an intrinsically disordered region of Med14. Phosphorylation of Med14 is essential for maintenance of enhancers that drive induction of beta cell-specific and diabetes-linked genes.

Here, we examined the dynamics and pathogenicity of CD4+ T cell responses to four different insulin-derived epitopes during diabetes initiation in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tetramer-sorted CD4+ T cells from the pancreas revealed that islet-antigen-specific T cells adopted a wide variety of fates and required XCR1+ dendritic cells for their activation. Hybrid-insulin C-chromogranin A (InsC-ChgA)-specific CD4+ T cells skewed toward a distinct Th1 (T helper type 1) effector phenotype, whereas the majority of insulin B chain and hybrid-insulin C-islet amyloid polypeptide-specific CD4+ T exhibited a regulatory T cell phenotype and early or weak Th1 phenotype, respectively. InsC-ChgA-specific CD4+ T cells were uniquely pathogenic upon transfer, and an anti-InsC-ChgA:IAg7 antibody prevented spontaneous diabetes. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of T cell responses to insulin-derived epitopes in diabetes and argue for the feasibility of antigen-specific therapies that blunts the response of pathogenic CD4+ T cells causing autoimmunity.",

Here, we found that branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), which catalyzes the first step of BCAAs metabolism, was predominantly expressed in retina M\u00fcller cells. Under diabetic conditions, BCAT1 showed increased enzymatic activity in M\u00fcller cells, which drove the remodeling of BCAAs catabolism, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Mechanistically, BCAT1 activity was negatively regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) via phosphorylation at threonine 333. Increased BCAT1 activity further reduced \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels, a critical substrate for histone demethylation, resulting in higher H3K4me3 levels at inflammatory gene promoters, and further upregulated inflammation genes. Treatment with chemical BCAT inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory gene expression and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas in vivo. These findings reveal a crucial role of BCAT1 in metabolic remodeling and inflammatory regulation, which indicates that BCAT1 could be used as a target for diabetic retinopathy.",

NF-\u03baB target genes play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in regulating the cellular response to cytokines. Here, using cytokine-stimulated pancreatic \u03b2-cells as an inflammatory disease model, we show that NF-\u03baB-dependent gene products that participate in inflammation are sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition.

It is therefore essential to understand the potential impact of metformin on placental ageing. Placental samples (n=105) were obtained from women with BMI \u226530kg/m2 randomised to treatment with metformin or placebo during pregnancy. Ageing was assessed by measuring telomere length, histological examination, and using array-based technologies to investigate gene expression and methylation. Results were validated using isolated human trophoblasts treated in vitro with metformin, and in a complementary mouse model. There were no differences between metformin-exposed and control placentas in terms of telomere length, fibrosis, or calcification. There were no differences in placental gene expression or methylation patterns by metformin status. In our mouse model, no genes classically associated with cellular ageing were differentially expressed and no senescence pathway showed evidence of enrichment with metformin treatment. There was no evidence that metformin either slows or accelerates placental ageing pathways in the complementary models that we investigated.

GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell viability in part via triggering of the beta cell GLP-1 receptor and subsequent induction of the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of CREB and induction of CREB target genes. By contrast with the acute effects of this pathway on immediate early CREB target genes, which attenuate the cAMP-CREB response, sustained exposure of beta cells to GLP-1 agonist (exenatide-4; Ex-4) or adenyl cyclase activator (Forskolin; FSK) stimulates the expression of beta cell specific CREB target genes with delayed kinetics. In a proteomic screen for transcriptional co-regulators that mediate the long-term effects of GLP-1, we identified Med14, a backbone subunit of the Mediator complex. Exposure to either Ex-4 or FSK stimulates Med14 phosphorylation at Ser983, corresponding to a conserved PKA recognition site (RRXS) that is located within an intrinsically disordered region of Med14. Phosphorylation of Med14 is essential for maintenance of enhancers that drive induction of beta cell-specific and diabetes-linked genes.  Mutation of Med14 at Ser983 to alanine decreased beta cell numbers and repressed growth factor signaling in primary mouse islets. Our work reveals how phosphorylation of a general transcription factor in response to GLP-1 analogs triggers a broad genomic response with salutary effects on beta cell function.",

Here, we found that branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), which catalyzes the first step of BCAAs metabolism, was predominantly expressed in retina M\u00fcller cells. Under diabetic conditions, BCAT1 showed increased enzymatic activity in M\u00fcller cells, which drove the remodeling of BCAAs catabolism, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Mechanistically, BCAT1 activity was negatively regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) via phosphorylation at threonine 333. Increased BCAT1 activity further reduced \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels, a critical substrate for histone demethylation, resulting in higher H3K4me3 levels at inflammatory gene promoters, and further upregulated inflammation genes. Treatment with chemical BCAT inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory gene expression and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas in vivo.

Inhibitors of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) epigenetic reader proteins attenuate inflammatory gene transcription and delay the onset of several inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diabetes. Our previous studies showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors disrupt the interaction between BET family member BRD4 and NF-\u03baB transcription factor p65 in \u03b2-cells, thus attenuating cytokine-stimulated NF-\u03baB-dependent gene and functional changes.

NF-\u03baB target genes play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in regulating the cellular response to cytokines. Here, using cytokine-stimulated pancreatic \u03b2-cells as an inflammatory disease model, we show that NF-\u03baB-dependent gene products that participate in inflammation are sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition.

Results were validated using isolated human trophoblasts treated in vitro with metformin, and in a complementary mouse model. There were no differences between metformin-exposed and control placentas in terms of telomere length, fibrosis, or calcification. There were no differences in placental gene expression or methylation patterns by metformin status. In our mouse model, no genes classically associated with cellular ageing were differentially expressed and no senescence pathway showed evidence of enrichment with metformin treatment.

            "summary": "Under feeding conditions, increases in circulating glucose concentrations trigger the release of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell viability in part via triggering of the beta cell GLP-1 receptor and subsequent induction of the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of CREB and induction of CREB target genes. By contrast with the acute effects of this pathway on immediate early CREB target genes, which attenuate the cAMP-CREB response, sustained exposure of beta cells to GLP-1 agonist (exenatide-4; Ex-4) or adenyl cyclase activator (Forskolin; FSK) stimulates the expression of beta cell specific CREB target genes with delayed kinetics. In a proteomic screen for transcriptional co-regulators that mediate the long-term effects of GLP-1, we identified Med14, a backbone subunit of the Mediator complex. Exposure to either Ex-4 or FSK stimulates Med14 phosphorylation at Ser983, corresponding to a conserved PKA recognition site (RRXS) that is located within an intrinsically disordered region of Med14. Phosphorylation of Med14 is essential for maintenance of enhancers that drive induction of beta cell-specific and diabetes-linked genes.  Mutation of Med14 at Ser983 to alanine decreased beta cell numbers and repressed growth factor signaling in primary mouse islets.

              "summary": "Under feeding conditions, increases in circulating glucose concentrations trigger the release of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell viability in part via triggering of the beta cell GLP-1 receptor and subsequent induction of the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of CREB and induction of CREB target genes. By contrast with the acute effects of this pathway on immediate early CREB target genes, which attenuate the cAMP-CREB response, sustained exposure of beta cells to GLP-1 agonist (exenatide-4; Ex-4) or adenyl cyclase activator (Forskolin; FSK) stimulates the expression of beta cell specific CREB target genes with delayed kinetics. In a proteomic screen for transcriptional co-regulators that mediate the long-term effects of GLP-1, we identified Med14, a backbone subunit of the Mediator complex. Exposure to either Ex-4 or FSK stimulates Med14 phosphorylation at Ser983, corresponding to a conserved PKA recognition site (RRXS) that is located within an intrinsically disordered region of Med14. Phosphorylation of Med14 is essential for maintenance of enhancers that drive induction of beta cell-specific and diabetes-linked genes.  Mutation of Med14 at Ser983 to alanine decreased beta cell numbers and repressed growth factor signaling in primary mouse islets. Our work reveals how phosphorylation of a general transcription factor in response to GLP-1 analogs triggers a broad genomic response with salutary effects on beta cell function.",

Under diabetic conditions, BCAT1 showed increased enzymatic activity in M\u00fcller cells, which drove the remodeling of BCAAs catabolism, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Mechanistically, BCAT1 activity was negatively regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) via phosphorylation at threonine 333. Increased BCAT1 activity further reduced \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels, a critical substrate for histone demethylation, resulting in higher H3K4me3 levels at inflammatory gene promoters, and further upregulated inflammation genes. Treatment with chemical BCAT inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory gene expression and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas in vivo.

        "summary": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism is dysregulated in diabetic retinopathy. Retina M\u00fcller cells maintain various metabolic processes and immune homeostasis. Here, we found that branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), which catalyzes the first step of BCAAs metabolism, was predominantly expressed in retina M\u00fcller cells. Under diabetic conditions, BCAT1 showed increased enzymatic activity in M\u00fcller cells, which drove the remodeling of BCAAs catabolism, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Mechanistically, BCAT1 activity was negatively regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) via phosphorylation at threonine 333. Increased BCAT1 activity further reduced \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels, a critical substrate for histone demethylation, resulting in higher H3K4me3 levels at inflammatory gene promoters, and further upregulated inflammation genes. Treatment with chemical BCAT inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory gene expression and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas in vivo. These findings reveal a crucial role of BCAT1 in metabolic remodeling and inflammatory regulation, which indicates that BCAT1 could be used as a target for diabetic retinopathy.",

        "summary": "Cytokine-stimulated transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes is linked to the development of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Inhibitors of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) epigenetic reader proteins attenuate inflammatory gene transcription and delay the onset of several inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diabetes. Our previous studies showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors disrupt the interaction between BET family member BRD4 and NF-\u03baB transcription factor p65 in \u03b2-cells, thus attenuating cytokine-stimulated NF-\u03baB-dependent gene and functional changes. However, the role of NF-\u03baB in developing inflammatory disease is controversial, as NF-\u03baB inhibition can promote disease progression in some contexts. NF-\u03baB target genes play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in regulating the cellular response to cytokines. Here, using cytokine-stimulated pancreatic \u03b2-cells as an inflammatory disease model, we show that NF-\u03baB-dependent gene products that participate in inflammation are sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. In contrast, gene products that maintain cellular homeostasis or protect \u03b2-cells from stressors are largely insensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. These studies define a novel and selective role for BET bromodomain-containing proteins in regulating inflammatory gene activation.",

Integration of ST with public single-cell RNA sequencing data enabled interrogation of transcriptional alterations in T1D across both tissues at the cellular scale. In the T1D pancreas, we identified global upregulation of inflammation-associated transcripts, including multiple regenerating islet-derived (REG) family genes, complement factor 3 (C3), SOD2, and OLFM4, and highlighted cellular candidates potentially contributing to these signatures. Within the T1D pLN, we observed spatially restricted upregulation of lymphotoxin-\uf062 (LTB) alongside follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-associated transcripts including FDCSP, CLU, and FCER2. Collectively, these findings highlight a distinct inflammation signature in the pancreas and evidence of enhanced follicular activity in the associated pLN.",

        "summary": "Placental ageing refers to the physiological accumulation of a senescent phenotype over healthy pregnancy. In pregnancies affected by complications such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, placental ageing is notably accelerated and observed at an earlier gestational age. Metformin is used during pregnancy for an increasing variety of indications, including treatment of gestational diabetes and may have a role in slowing cellular ageing. It is therefore essential to understand the potential impact of metformin on placental ageing. Placental samples (n=105) were obtained from women with BMI \u226530kg/m2 randomised to treatment with metformin or placebo during pregnancy. Ageing was assessed by measuring telomere length, histological examination, and using array-based technologies to investigate gene expression and methylation. Results were validated using isolated human trophoblasts treated in vitro with metformin, and in a complementary mouse model. There were no differences between metformin-exposed and control placentas in terms of telomere length, fibrosis, or calcification. There were no differences in placental gene expression or methylation patterns by metformin status. In our mouse model, no genes classically associated with cellular ageing were differentially expressed and no senescence pathway showed evidence of enrichment with metformin treatment. There was no evidence that metformin either slows or accelerates placental ageing pathways in the complementary models that we investigated. Our findings are reassuring with regards to the safety of metformin used to treat gestational diabetes, but do not support a role for metformin in the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes in non-diabetic women.",
