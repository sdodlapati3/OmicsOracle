However, the genome-wide dynamics of mRNA metabolism throughout the cell cycle remain uncharacterized. Here, we combined single-cell multiome sequencing, biophysical modeling, and  deep learning to quantify rates of mRNA transcription, splicing, nuclear export, and degradation. Our approach revealed that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes exhibit distinct oscillatory waves at specific cell cycle phases, with post-transcriptional regulation playing a prominent role in shaping mRNA accumulation. We also observed dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding footprints, identifying key regulators underlying the oscillatory dynamics of mRNA. Taken together, our approach  uncovered a high-resolution map of RNA metabolism dynamics and chromatin accessibility, offering new insights into the temporal control of gene expression in proliferating cells.",

Relevant models should at least include hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and ideally use three-dimensional cultures to mimic in vivo conditions. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allow patient-specific liver modelling, but current models based on iPSC-derived hepatocytes (iHepatocytes) and HSCs (iHSCs) still lack key functions. We developed organoids of iHepatocytes and iHSCs, and compared them to HepaRG and primary HSC organoids. RNA-sequencing analysis comparison of these cultures identified a potential role for the transcription factor RXRA in hepatocyte differentiation and HSC quiescence. Treating cells with the RXRA ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA) promoted iHepatocyte metabolism and iHSC quiescence. In organoids, 9CRA enhanced fibrotic response to TGF-\u03b2 and acetaminophen, highlighting its potential for refining iPSC-based liver fibrosis models to more faithfully replicate human drug-induced liver injury and fibrotic conditions.",

It is important to understand how KMT2A mutations drive such aggressive disease in order to develop more effective and less toxic therapies. The PROM1 gene, encoding the pentaspan glycoprotein prominin-1/CD133, is activated by the direct action of the most common KMT2A fusion protein; KMT2A::AFF1 (MLL-AF4). CD133 expression is essential for proliferation of KMT2A::AFF1+ cell lines but its role in primary disease remains unclear with heterogenous expression seen in iALL patient samples. To clarify the role of CD133 in KMT2Ar iALL we have used a highly physiological primary human fetal liver derived model (CRISPRKMT2A::AFF1 ALL) which recapitulates CD133 heterogeneity. We show that CD133 expression marks a highly proliferative subset of CRISPRKMT2A::AFF1 blasts with a stem-cell gene expression profile capable of causing more aggressive disease in vivo. CRISPR inactivation of PROM1 limits leukemic proliferation, suggesting a functional role in our model and providing a strong rationale for targeting therapies against CD133.",

It is important to understand how KMT2A mutations drive such aggressive disease in order to develop more effective and less toxic therapies. The PROM1 gene, encoding the pentaspan glycoprotein prominin-1/CD133, is activated by the direct action of the most common KMT2A fusion protein; KMT2A::AFF1 (MLL-AF4). CD133 expression is essential for proliferation of KMT2A::AFF1+ cell lines but its role in primary disease remains unclear with heterogenous expression seen in iALL patient samples. To clarify the role of CD133 in KMT2Ar iALL we have used a highly physiological primary human fetal liver derived model (CRISPRKMT2A::AFF1 ALL) which recapitulates CD133 heterogeneity. We show that CD133 expression marks a highly proliferative subset of CRISPRKMT2A::AFF1 blasts with a stem-cell gene expression profile capable of causing more aggressive disease in vivo. CRISPR inactivation of PROM1 limits leukemic proliferation, suggesting a functional role in our model and providing a strong rationale for targeting therapies against CD133.",

Here, we combined single-cell multiome sequencing, biophysical modeling, and  deep learning to quantify rates of mRNA transcription, splicing, nuclear export, and degradation.

We also observed dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding footprints, identifying key regulators underlying the oscillatory dynamics of mRNA.
