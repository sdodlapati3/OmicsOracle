              "summary": "Cytokine-stimulated transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes is linked to the development of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Inhibitors of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) epigenetic reader proteins attenuate inflammatory gene transcription and delay the onset of several inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diabetes. Our previous studies showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors disrupt the interaction between BET family member BRD4 and NF-\u03baB transcription factor p65 in \u03b2-cells, thus attenuating cytokine-stimulated NF-\u03baB-dependent gene and functional changes. However, the role of NF-\u03baB in developing inflammatory disease is controversial, as NF-\u03baB inhibition can promote disease progression in some contexts. NF-\u03baB target genes play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in regulating the cellular response to cytokines. Here, using cytokine-stimulated pancreatic \u03b2-cells as an inflammatory disease model, we show that NF-\u03baB-dependent gene products that participate in inflammation are sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. In contrast, gene products that maintain cellular homeostasis or protect \u03b2-cells from stressors are largely insensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. These studies define a novel and selective role for BET bromodomain-containing proteins in regulating inflammatory gene activation.",

Integration of ST with public single-cell RNA sequencing data enabled interrogation of transcriptional alterations in T1D across both tissues at the cellular scale. In the T1D pancreas, we identified global upregulation of inflammation-associated transcripts, including multiple regenerating islet-derived (REG) family genes, complement factor 3 (C3), SOD2, and OLFM4, and highlighted cellular candidates potentially contributing to these signatures. Within the T1D pLN, we observed spatially restricted upregulation of lymphotoxin-\uf062 (LTB) alongside follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-associated transcripts including FDCSP, CLU, and FCER2. Collectively, these findings highlight a distinct inflammation signature in the pancreas and evidence of enhanced follicular activity in the associated pLN.",

Here, we examined the dynamics and pathogenicity of CD4+ T cell responses to four different insulin-derived epitopes during diabetes initiation in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tetramer-sorted CD4+ T cells from the pancreas revealed that islet-antigen-specific T cells adopted a wide variety of fates and required XCR1+ dendritic cells for their activation. Hybrid-insulin C-chromogranin A (InsC-ChgA)-specific CD4+ T cells skewed toward a distinct Th1 (T helper type 1) effector phenotype, whereas the majority of insulin B chain and hybrid-insulin C-islet amyloid polypeptide-specific CD4+ T exhibited a regulatory T cell phenotype and early or weak Th1 phenotype, respectively. InsC-ChgA-specific CD4+ T cells were uniquely pathogenic upon transfer, and an anti-InsC-ChgA:IAg7 antibody prevented spontaneous diabetes. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of T cell responses to insulin-derived epitopes in diabetes and argue for the feasibility of antigen-specific therapies that blunts the response of pathogenic CD4+ T cells causing autoimmunity.",

In this context, we tested the ability of THR-123, a cyclic peptide with BMP-7-like activity, to restore b-cell mass in diabetic mice. Here we show that treatment with THR-123 restores normoglycemia through the rapid formation of new BrdU-labeled islets in the vicinity of ducts. Neogenic islets, unlike those from non-diabetic controls, feature an extensive intrainsular network of ductal tissue. The earlier stages of THR-123-induced b-cell neogenesis were reproduced in live pancreatic slices, an organotypic model that allowed us to visualize ductal cells transitioning to glucose-responsive insulin-expressing cells in real time. scRNAseq analyses further confirmed that this transition occurs through a hybrid ducto-acinar stage similar to that previously reported in humans. These results pave the way to the design of pharmacological strategies to treat insulin-dependent diabetes.",

              "title": "The canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway upregulates carbonic anhydrase 2 via transcription factor 7-like 2 to promote cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetic mice",
              "summary": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus. Excessive activation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the main \u03b2-catenin partner of the TCF family in adult human hearts. In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in the development of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by using streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) as in-vivo and in-vitro models of T2DM, respectively. Compared with the control mice, the T2DM mice exhibited increased myocardial \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2 expression that was concentrated in the nucleus. Treatment of diabetic mice with the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite inhibitor iCRT14 prevented myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac dysfunction. iCRT14 also prevented high glucose-induced hypertrophy in NRCMs, while the \u03b2-catenin stabilizer SKL2001 worsened hypertrophy. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the formation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite in the control and T2DM mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) was upregulated in T2DM cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. TCF7L2 overexpression upregulated CA2, while iCRT14 treatment or TCF7L2 knockdown downregulated CA2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed an increased interaction between \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 and the transcription initiation region of CA2 in the heart tissue of T2DM mice. CA2 knockdown ameliorated NRCM hypertrophy induced by high glucose and SKL2001. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CA2 is directly regulated by the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite. Collectively, these results indicate that the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway upregulates CA2 via TCF7L2 to promote cardiomyopathy in T2DM. This research sheds new light on the pathogenesis of DCM and presents new potential therapeutic targets for this disease.",
              "overall_design": "Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were isolated from 1\u20132-day-old neonatal SD rats. In brief, hearts collected from anesthetized neonatal rats were digested with pancreatic enzymes and type II collagenase. For TCF7L2 overexpression or knockdown, the NRCMs were infected with Lenti-TCF7L2, Lenti-shTCF7L2 , or Lenti-NC (Lentiviral vector control) for 16 h, followed by incubation in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from lenti-TCF7L2-, lenti-shTCF7L2 -or lenti-NC-infected NRCMs using a Trizol reagent kit. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained fromRNA-seq of lentiviral infected cardiomyocytes.

              "summary": "Pancreatic islet transplantation stands out as a promising therapeutic avenue for type 1 diabetes patients grappling with glycemic instability and hypoglycemia unawareness. Given the persistent scarcity of donor organs, there is growing anticipation that pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation will emerge as the definitive beta cell replacement therapy for this condition. The liver is the site of preclinical pig-to-NHP islet transplantation as well as allogeneic clinical transplantation, yet there\u2019s still a lack of understanding on the pathology of the liver after the transplantation procedure. Based on our observations of post-transplantation periportal pathologic changes in primate models, we have conducted a retrospective study examining the hepatic pathology in pig-to-NHP islet recipients with short-term graft survival, employing a state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomic platform within the vicinity of the islet implantation site. Post-transplantation liver tissue could be easily distinguished into three regions based on transcriptional profiles, consistent with its histology. A notable elevation in adipogenesis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathways could be identified, which included increased expression of SREBF1, CEBPA, IGF1, and TNFRSF12A. We furthermore discovered that, despite the decreased severity of the multifocal white lesions indicated by gross examination at 33 days post-transplantation, there was still evidence of NAFLD at the transcriptional level. These results prompt further research into the relationship between intrahepatic islet transplantation and hepatic microenvironment.",

              "summary": "BACKGROUND: Although gestational diabetes affects up to 10% of all pregnancies, there is ambiguity as to whether the disease subtype classifications are biologically significant at the maternal-fetal interface, or more reflective of an extended spectrum of normal pregnancy endocrine physiology.  OBJECTIVE: Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics have been integrated to reveal gene signatures of disease in subsets of cells and microenvironments. We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that differences between pre-existing and gestational diabetes subtypes would be associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell populations.  STUDY DESIGN: In a two-phase case-cohort design, we clinically validated gestational diabetes mellitus type 1 (GDMA1), GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) cases within a cohort of placentae and compared them to healthy controls by bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analysis with RT-qPCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort of similarly well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of term placenta single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures.  RESULTS: Dimension reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2,052 unique significantly differentially expressed transcripts (-2<Log2(fold-change)>2 threshold; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, and 1,520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (CSH1, PER1, PIK3CB, FOXO1, EGFR, IL2RB, SOD3, DOCK5, and SOGA1) were validated in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for each diabetes subtype, and degree of proximal similarity to other subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM were more proximal by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased expression of genes in the wound healing pathway. Assessment of these gene signatures in the single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data revealed expression of these genes were highly variable by placental cell and microarchitecture type. For example, at the cellular and spatial (e.g., microarchitectural) levels, distinguishing features were observed in  in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to generate machine learning models to predict participants diabetes status and observed greater proximity of placental gene expression among GDMA1 and T2DM participants relative to GDMA2.  CONCLUSION: Consistent with their distinct risks of perinatal outcomes, placentae from GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM affected pregnancies harbor gene signatures which can be further distinguished by placental microarchitecture and cellular subtypes.",

Excessive activation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the main \u03b2-catenin partner of the TCF family in adult human hearts. In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in the development of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by using streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) as in-vivo and in-vitro models of T2DM, respectively. Compared with the control mice, the T2DM mice exhibited increased myocardial \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2 expression that was concentrated in the nucleus. Treatment of diabetic mice with the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite inhibitor iCRT14 prevented myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac dysfunction. iCRT14 also prevented high glucose-induced hypertrophy in NRCMs, while the \u03b2-catenin stabilizer SKL2001 worsened hypertrophy. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the formation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite in the control and T2DM mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) was upregulated in T2DM cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. TCF7L2 overexpression upregulated CA2, while iCRT14 treatment or TCF7L2 knockdown downregulated CA2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed an increased interaction between \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 and the transcription initiation region of CA2 in the heart tissue of T2DM mice. CA2 knockdown ameliorated NRCM hypertrophy induced by high glucose and SKL2001. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CA2 is directly regulated by the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite.

          "summary": "Pancreatic islet transplantation stands out as a promising therapeutic avenue for type 1 diabetes patients grappling with glycemic instability and hypoglycemia unawareness. Given the persistent scarcity of donor organs, there is growing anticipation that pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation will emerge as the definitive beta cell replacement therapy for this condition. The liver is the site of preclinical pig-to-NHP islet transplantation as well as allogeneic clinical transplantation, yet there\u2019s still a lack of understanding on the pathology of the liver after the transplantation procedure. Based on our observations of post-transplantation periportal pathologic changes in primate models, we have conducted a retrospective study examining the hepatic pathology in pig-to-NHP islet recipients with short-term graft survival, employing a state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomic platform within the vicinity of the islet implantation site.

Given the persistent scarcity of donor organs, there is growing anticipation that pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation will emerge as the definitive beta cell replacement therapy for this condition. The liver is the site of preclinical pig-to-NHP islet transplantation as well as allogeneic clinical transplantation, yet there\u2019s still a lack of understanding on the pathology of the liver after the transplantation procedure. Based on our observations of post-transplantation periportal pathologic changes in primate models, we have conducted a retrospective study examining the hepatic pathology in pig-to-NHP islet recipients with short-term graft survival, employing a state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomic platform within the vicinity of the islet implantation site.

          "summary": "BACKGROUND: Although gestational diabetes affects up to 10% of all pregnancies, there is ambiguity as to whether the disease subtype classifications are biologically significant at the maternal-fetal interface, or more reflective of an extended spectrum of normal pregnancy endocrine physiology.  OBJECTIVE: Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics have been integrated to reveal gene signatures of disease in subsets of cells and microenvironments. We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that differences between pre-existing and gestational diabetes subtypes would be associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell populations.  STUDY DESIGN: In a two-phase case-cohort design, we clinically validated gestational diabetes mellitus type 1 (GDMA1), GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) cases within a cohort of placentae and compared them to healthy controls by bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analysis with RT-qPCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort of similarly well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of term placenta single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures.  RESULTS: Dimension reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2,052 unique significantly differentially expressed transcripts (-2<Log2(fold-change)>2 threshold; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, and 1,520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (CSH1, PER1, PIK3CB, FOXO1, EGFR, IL2RB, SOD3, DOCK5, and SOGA1) were validated in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for each diabetes subtype, and degree of proximal similarity to other subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM were more proximal by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased expression of genes in the wound healing pathway. Assessment of these gene signatures in the single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data revealed expression of these genes were highly variable by placental cell and microarchitecture type. For example, at the cellular and spatial (e.g., microarchitectural) levels, distinguishing features were observed in  in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to generate machine learning models to predict participants diabetes status and observed greater proximity of placental gene expression among GDMA1 and T2DM participants relative to GDMA2.  CONCLUSION: Consistent with their distinct risks of perinatal outcomes, placentae from GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM affected pregnancies harbor gene signatures which can be further distinguished by placental microarchitecture and cellular subtypes.",

Excessive activation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the main \u03b2-catenin partner of the TCF family in adult human hearts. In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in the development of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by using streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) as in-vivo and in-vitro models of T2DM, respectively. Compared with the control mice, the T2DM mice exhibited increased myocardial \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2 expression that was concentrated in the nucleus. Treatment of diabetic mice with the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite inhibitor iCRT14 prevented myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac dysfunction. iCRT14 also prevented high glucose-induced hypertrophy in NRCMs, while the \u03b2-catenin stabilizer SKL2001 worsened hypertrophy. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the formation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite in the control and T2DM mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) was upregulated in T2DM cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. TCF7L2 overexpression upregulated CA2, while iCRT14 treatment or TCF7L2 knockdown downregulated CA2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed an increased interaction between \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 and the transcription initiation region of CA2 in the heart tissue of T2DM mice. CA2 knockdown ameliorated NRCM hypertrophy induced by high glucose and SKL2001. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CA2 is directly regulated by the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite. Collectively, these results indicate that the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway upregulates CA2 via TCF7L2 to promote cardiomyopathy in T2DM. This research sheds new light on the pathogenesis of DCM and presents new potential therapeutic targets for this disease.",

              "geo_summary": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus. Excessive activation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the main \u03b2-catenin partner of the TCF family in adult human hearts. In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in the development of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by using streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) as in-vivo and in-vitro models of T2DM, respectively. Compared with the control mice, the T2DM mice exhibited increased myocardial \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2 expression that was concentrated in the nucleus. Treatment of diabetic mice with the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite inhibitor iCRT14 prevented myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac dysfunction. iCRT14 also prevented high glucose-induced hypertrophy in NRCMs, while the \u03b2-catenin stabilizer SKL2001 worsened hypertrophy.

OBJECTIVE: Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics have been integrated to reveal gene signatures of disease in subsets of cells and microenvironments. We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that differences between pre-existing and gestational diabetes subtypes would be associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell populations.  STUDY DESIGN: In a two-phase case-cohort design, we clinically validated gestational diabetes mellitus type 1 (GDMA1), GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) cases within a cohort of placentae and compared them to healthy controls by bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analysis with RT-qPCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort of similarly well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of term placenta single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures.  RESULTS: Dimension reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2,052 unique significantly differentially expressed transcripts (-2<Log2(fold-change)>2 threshold; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, and 1,520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (CSH1, PER1, PIK3CB, FOXO1, EGFR, IL2RB, SOD3, DOCK5, and SOGA1) were validated in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for each diabetes subtype, and degree of proximal similarity to other subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM were more proximal by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased expression of genes in the wound healing pathway. Assessment of these gene signatures in the single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data revealed expression of these genes were highly variable by placental cell and microarchitecture type. For example, at the cellular and spatial (e.g., microarchitectural) levels, distinguishing features were observed in  in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to generate machine learning models to predict participants diabetes status and observed greater proximity of placental gene expression among GDMA1 and T2DM participants relative to GDMA2.

In this context, we tested the ability of THR-123, a cyclic peptide with BMP-7-like activity, to restore b-cell mass in diabetic mice. Here we show that treatment with THR-123 restores normoglycemia through the rapid formation of new BrdU-labeled islets in the vicinity of ducts. Neogenic islets, unlike those from non-diabetic controls, feature an extensive intrainsular network of ductal tissue. The earlier stages of THR-123-induced b-cell neogenesis were reproduced in live pancreatic slices, an organotypic model that allowed us to visualize ductal cells transitioning to glucose-responsive insulin-expressing cells in real time. scRNAseq analyses further confirmed that this transition occurs through a hybrid ducto-acinar stage similar to that previously reported in humans.

In this context, we tested the ability of THR-123, a cyclic peptide with BMP-7-like activity, to restore b-cell mass in diabetic mice. Here we show that treatment with THR-123 restores normoglycemia through the rapid formation of new BrdU-labeled islets in the vicinity of ducts. Neogenic islets, unlike those from non-diabetic controls, feature an extensive intrainsular network of ductal tissue. The earlier stages of THR-123-induced b-cell neogenesis were reproduced in live pancreatic slices, an organotypic model that allowed us to visualize ductal cells transitioning to glucose-responsive insulin-expressing cells in real time. scRNAseq analyses further confirmed that this transition occurs through a hybrid ducto-acinar stage similar to that previously reported in humans.

Excessive activation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the main \u03b2-catenin partner of the TCF family in adult human hearts. In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in the development of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by using streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) as in-vivo and in-vitro models of T2DM, respectively. Compared with the control mice, the T2DM mice exhibited increased myocardial \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2 expression that was concentrated in the nucleus. Treatment of diabetic mice with the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite inhibitor iCRT14 prevented myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac dysfunction. iCRT14 also prevented high glucose-induced hypertrophy in NRCMs, while the \u03b2-catenin stabilizer SKL2001 worsened hypertrophy. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the formation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite in the control and T2DM mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) was upregulated in T2DM cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. TCF7L2 overexpression upregulated CA2, while iCRT14 treatment or TCF7L2 knockdown downregulated CA2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed an increased interaction between \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 and the transcription initiation region of CA2 in the heart tissue of T2DM mice. CA2 knockdown ameliorated NRCM hypertrophy induced by high glucose and SKL2001. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CA2 is directly regulated by the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite.

We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that differences between pre-existing and gestational diabetes subtypes would be associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell populations.  STUDY DESIGN: In a two-phase case-cohort design, we clinically validated gestational diabetes mellitus type 1 (GDMA1), GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) cases within a cohort of placentae and compared them to healthy controls by bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analysis with RT-qPCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort of similarly well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of term placenta single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures.  RESULTS: Dimension reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2,052 unique significantly differentially expressed transcripts (-2<Log2(fold-change)>2 threshold; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, and 1,520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (CSH1, PER1, PIK3CB, FOXO1, EGFR, IL2RB, SOD3, DOCK5, and SOGA1) were validated in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for each diabetes subtype, and degree of proximal similarity to other subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM were more proximal by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased expression of genes in the wound healing pathway. Assessment of these gene signatures in the single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data revealed expression of these genes were highly variable by placental cell and microarchitecture type. For example, at the cellular and spatial (e.g., microarchitectural) levels, distinguishing features were observed in  in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to generate machine learning models to predict participants diabetes status and observed greater proximity of placental gene expression among GDMA1 and T2DM participants relative to GDMA2.

InsC-ChgA-specific CD4+ T cells were uniquely pathogenic upon transfer, and an anti-InsC-ChgA:IAg7 antibody prevented spontaneous diabetes.

Excessive activation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in the development of cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by using streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) as in-vivo and in-vitro models of T2DM, respectively. Compared with the control mice, the T2DM mice exhibited increased myocardial \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2 expression that was concentrated in the nucleus. Treatment of diabetic mice with the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite inhibitor iCRT14 prevented myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac dysfunction. iCRT14 also prevented high glucose-induced hypertrophy in NRCMs, while the \u03b2-catenin stabilizer SKL2001 worsened hypertrophy. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the formation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite in the control and T2DM mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) was upregulated in T2DM cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. TCF7L2 overexpression upregulated CA2, while iCRT14 treatment or TCF7L2 knockdown downregulated CA2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed an increased interaction between \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 and the transcription initiation region of CA2 in the heart tissue of T2DM mice. CA2 knockdown ameliorated NRCM hypertrophy induced by high glucose and SKL2001. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CA2 is directly regulated by the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 bipartite.

OBJECTIVE: Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics have been integrated to reveal gene signatures of disease in subsets of cells and microenvironments. We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that differences between pre-existing and gestational diabetes subtypes would be associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell populations.  STUDY DESIGN: In a two-phase case-cohort design, we clinically validated gestational diabetes mellitus type 1 (GDMA1), GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) cases within a cohort of placentae and compared them to healthy controls by bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analysis with RT-qPCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort of similarly well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of term placenta single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures.  RESULTS: Dimension reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2,052 unique significantly differentially expressed transcripts (-2<Log2(fold-change)>2 threshold; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, and 1,520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (CSH1, PER1, PIK3CB, FOXO1, EGFR, IL2RB, SOD3, DOCK5, and SOGA1) were validated in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for each diabetes subtype, and degree of proximal similarity to other subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM were more proximal by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased expression of genes in the wound healing pathway.

For example, at the cellular and spatial (e.g., microarchitectural) levels, distinguishing features were observed in  in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to generate machine learning models to predict participants diabetes status and observed greater proximity of placental gene expression among GDMA1 and T2DM participants relative to GDMA2.

In contrast, gene products that maintain cellular homeostasis or protect \u03b2-cells from stressors are largely insensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. These studies define a novel and selective role for BET bromodomain-containing proteins in regulating inflammatory gene activation.",
