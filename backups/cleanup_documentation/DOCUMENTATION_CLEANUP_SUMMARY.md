### **Key Changes Made**
- âœ… Consolidated multiple cleanup documents into backup storage
- âœ… Created comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` with query flow diagrams
- âœ… Updated `README.md` to reference architecture documentation
- âœ… Maintained essential documentation in root directory
- âœ… Preserved cleanup history in `backups/cleanup_documentation/`

### **Benefits**
- **Simplified navigation** - Only 2 essential docs in root
- **Clear architecture overview** - Complete system understanding in one place
- **Focused on active system** - No cleanup artifacts cluttering workspace
- **Preserved history** - All cleanup documentation safely backed up

### **Documentation Purpose**
- `README.md` â†’ First-time users, quick setup, project overview
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` â†’ Developers, system understanding, query flow
- `docs/` â†’ Detailed technical documentation
- `backups/` â†’ Historical records and removed components

**Result**: Clean, professional documentation structure focused on the current system architecture and core components involved in query processing.
