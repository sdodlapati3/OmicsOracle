# GSE278726 Data Integrity Investigation Report

**Date:** June 26, 2025
**Investigator:** Data Integrity Team
**Subject:** Investigation of GSE278726 Content Mismatch

## Executive Summary

We have completed a thorough investigation into the reported data integrity issue where GSE278726 was allegedly displaying COVID-19 content despite being a cardiovascular disease study. Our investigation conclusively finds that:

1. GSE278726 is a valid GEO Series ID in the NCBI GEO database
2. The correct content for GSE278726 relates to "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis"
3. The OmicsOracle system is currently displaying the correct content for this GSE ID
4. No COVID-19 related content is being displayed for this GSE ID

We found no evidence of the reported data integrity issue in the current system. The GSE ID is correctly mapped to its associated content with 100% title and summary similarity to the NCBI GEO database.

## Investigation Methodology

Our investigation employed multiple approaches to verify the data integrity:

1. **NCBI GEO Verification**: We directly queried the NCBI GEO database using both Entrez eUtils API and direct GEO queries to establish the ground truth for GSE278726.

2. **OmicsOracle API Testing**: We performed direct API queries to the OmicsOracle search endpoint to retrieve the content displayed for GSE278726.

3. **Content Similarity Analysis**: We compared the content from both sources using textual similarity measures to detect any mismatches.

4. **COVID-19 Term Detection**: We specifically looked for COVID-19 related terms in the content displayed for GSE278726.

## Findings

### NCBI GEO Data (Ground Truth)

- **GSE ID**: GSE278726
- **Title**: "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"
- **Exists in NCBI GEO**: Yes
- **Related to COVID-19**: No

### OmicsOracle System Data

- **Title**: "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"
- **Title Similarity to NCBI**: 100%
- **Summary Similarity to NCBI**: 100%
- **Contains COVID-19 Terms**: No

### Direct Content Search Results

We performed several search queries to test if GSE278726 might display with COVID-19 content under certain search conditions:

1. Direct GSE ID search: Correctly shows cardiovascular disease content
2. COVID-19 search terms: GSE278726 does not appear in these results
3. Cardiovascular terms with GSE278726: Correctly shows cardiovascular disease content

## Analysis

The comprehensive testing reveals no evidence of the reported issue where GSE278726 would display with COVID-19 content. The system is correctly mapping this GSE ID to its appropriate content from NCBI GEO.

Possible explanations for the previously reported issue:

1. **Resolved Issue**: The issue may have existed but was resolved during the recent codebase cleanup where all mock and fallback data was removed.

2. **Transient Issue**: It may have been a temporary caching or data mapping issue that resolved itself through system updates.

3. **Misreporting**: The issue may have been incorrectly reported, possibly confusing this GSE ID with another one.

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Monitoring**: Although we found no issues, continue to monitor GSE278726 and other GSE IDs for potential data integrity issues.

2. **Expand Validation Coverage**: Regularly run the validation scripts across a wider range of GSE IDs to ensure broad data integrity.

3. **Documentation Update**: Update documentation to reflect that the reported issue with GSE278726 has been investigated and no data integrity issues were found.

4. **User Communication**: Inform users who reported the issue that it has been thoroughly investigated and appears to be resolved.

## Conclusion

Based on our comprehensive investigation, we conclude that GSE278726 is currently displaying the correct content in the OmicsOracle system. There is no evidence of COVID-19 content being incorrectly associated with this GSE ID.

The data integrity validation system we've implemented can continue to monitor this and other GSE IDs to ensure ongoing data integrity.

# ADDENDUM: New Content Mismatch Findings (June 26, 2025)

## New Issues Detected

After completing our initial investigation, we've identified new data integrity issues in the search function of the OmicsOracle system. A query for "chromatin accessibility data for heart tissue for human" revealed several critical content mismatches:

1. **GSE278726 Content Mismatch**:
   - In search results, GSE278726 is incorrectly showing content about "Common schizophrenia risk variants are implicated in the function of glutamatergic neurons"
   - This differs entirely from both the NCBI GEO data and our direct API testing which showed cardiovascular disease content

2. **Title/Content Swap Between GSE IDs**:
   - The cardiovascular disease content that should be associated with GSE278726 appears to be incorrectly assigned to GSE291262
   - The summary text is identical to what should be shown for GSE278726

3. **COVID-19 Content Appearing in Results**:
   - While our initial investigation focused on GSE278726 showing COVID-19 content incorrectly, the search results show COVID-19 content now associated with GSE291260

4. **Fixed Result Count Issue**:
   - The system appears to always return exactly 10 results regardless of actual match count
   - This suggests a possible hardcoded limit or pagination issue in the search function

## Implications

These findings indicate that while direct GSE ID lookups may show correct data (as validated in our initial investigation), the search function has data integrity issues that persist. The problem appears to be more complex than initially thought - it's not just a single GSE ID being incorrect but potentially a systemic issue with how content is mapped to GSE IDs during search operations.

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Expand Validation Scope**:
   - Update validation scripts to check multiple GSE IDs in search results, especially GSE291262 and GSE291260
   - Implement search result validation in addition to direct ID lookups

2. **Pipeline Investigation**:
   - Trace the entire search pipeline to identify where GSE IDs might be getting remapped
   - Check for differences between direct API calls and search functionality

3. **Search Function Audit**:
   - Review search indexing and retrieval logic
   - Investigate if there are fallback or sample data mechanisms still active in search but not in direct lookups

4. **Emergency Fix Plan**:
   - Temporarily disable search functionality if necessary
   - Prioritize fixing the content mapping issue before addressing result count limitations

## Updated Conclusion

The direct API validation for GSE278726 showed correct data, but the search function reveals persistent data integrity issues affecting multiple GSE IDs. This requires immediate attention as it could lead to researchers obtaining incorrect information when using search rather than direct ID lookups.

This addendum serves as documentation of ongoing data integrity challenges that extend beyond the original scope of the GSE278726 investigation.

# ADDENDUM 2: Validation Script Results (June 26, 2025)

## Validation Script Findings

We have run the newly created validation scripts to systematically test both direct ID lookups and search functionality. The results confirm our suspicions about data integrity issues in the search function:

### Direct ID Lookup Results
- **GSE278726 Direct API Lookup**: Correctly displays cardiovascular disease content
  - NCBI Title: "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"
  - Our API Title: "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"
  - Title Similarity: 100.0%
  - Summary Similarity: 100.0%
  - Verdict: PARTIAL_MATCH (likely due to organism field differences)

### Search Function Issues
- **GSE ID Validation**: Only 33.3% match rate when validating GSE278726, GSE291262, and GSE291260
- **Search Timeouts**: Observed multiple search timeouts when querying for GSE291262 and GSE291260
- **Query Timeouts**: Searches for "chromatin accessibility heart human" time out after 60 seconds
- **Combined Search Issues**: Searching for multiple GSE IDs together ("GSE278726 OR GSE291262 OR GSE291260") also results in timeouts

## Analysis of Validation Results

These validation results reveal several important insights:

1. **Dual System Behavior**: The system behaves differently for direct API lookups vs. search queries
   - Direct lookups retrieve correct data from the proper data source
   - Search functionality appears to be using a different data source or has indexing/retrieval issues

2. **Search Function Performance Issues**: The consistent timeouts suggest:
   - Search functionality may be misconfigured or overloaded
   - Search may be hitting a different server or database than direct API calls
   - Timeout threshold of 60 seconds is being reached consistently

3. **Confirmed Data Integrity Issues**: The initial findings of content mismatches in search results are consistent with the validation results showing only a 33.3% match rate

## Updated Action Plan

Based on these new findings, we're updating our action plan with these additional steps:

1. **System Architecture Review**:
   - Determine if search and direct API calls are using different data stores
   - Check if search is properly connected to the correct database

2. **Performance Investigation**:
   - Diagnose why search queries are timing out after 60 seconds
   - Check search server logs during the timeouts

3. **Testing with Simplified Queries**:
   - Test with simpler search terms to see if performance improves
   - Check if the same mismatches occur with different search terms

4. **Database Consistency Check**:
   - Verify the consistency between the search index and primary database
   - Check for any automated processes that might be affecting search data integrity

The search timeouts make it difficult to conclusively determine if the content mismatches we observed earlier persist, but the 33.3% match rate for GSE IDs strongly suggests that there are continuing data integrity issues that require immediate attention.

# ADDENDUM 3: Search Function Diagnostics (June 26, 2025)

## Diagnostic Tool Results

We performed additional diagnostic tests using our newly developed `diagnose_search_function.py` tool to further investigate the search functionality issues. The results provide critical insights into the system's behavior:

### Direct API vs. Search Comparison
- **Direct API Calls for GSE278726**: Failed with an ERROR in 0.01s
- **Search API for GSE278726**: Succeeded in 7.89s, returning 10 results
  - Target GSE ID (GSE278726) was found in the results
  - Title displayed: "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"

### Search Timing Tests
We ran comprehensive timing tests with the query "heart" using different timeout settings:

- **5s timeout**: All 3 tests timed out (after ~6s)
- **10s timeout**: All 3 tests timed out (after ~11s)
- **20s timeout**:
  - First iteration: SUCCESS in 1.92s - 10 results
  - Second iteration: SUCCESS in 0.04s - 10 results
  - Third iteration: SUCCESS in 0.03s - 10 results
- **30s, 45s, 60s timeouts**: All tests successful, with consistent response times around 0.03s after the first successful query

## Analysis of Diagnostic Results

These diagnostic results reveal several critical patterns:

1. **Direct API vs. Search Discrepancy**:
   - The direct API call failed with an error while the search function succeeded
   - This indicates the systems are likely using different backends or data access methods
   - The correct title for GSE278726 was found via search, suggesting data integrity in search results may be intermittent

2. **Search Caching Behavior**:
   - First successful search query took 1.92s
   - Subsequent queries were extremely fast (0.03-0.04s)
   - This suggests a caching mechanism is active but requires initial population

3. **Minimum Timeout Requirement**:
   - Searches consistently fail with 5s and 10s timeouts
   - 20s appears to be the minimum reliable timeout setting
   - This explains why some validation tests might have failed due to timeout settings

4. **Inconsistent System Behavior**:
   - Direct API failures combined with search successes suggest the systems are disconnected
   - Previous content mismatches may be due to the systems using different data sources

## Updated Action Plan

Based on these new diagnostics, we're further refining our action plan:

1. **API Connection Investigation**:
   - Determine why direct API calls are failing while search succeeds
   - Check for API service availability and connection issues
   - Investigate if these services are running on different infrastructure

2. **Caching Optimization**:
   - Review the current caching mechanisms in the search backend
   - Evaluate if pre-warming caches could prevent timeouts
   - Check if cache invalidation might be causing intermittent data integrity issues

3. **Timeout Configuration**:
   - Update all system components to use a minimum 20s timeout when interacting with the search API
   - Review existing timeout settings across the codebase

4. **Controlled Environment Testing**:
   - Set up controlled test environments to isolate variables
   - Run A/B testing between direct API and search functionality
   - Systematically test more GSE IDs to identify patterns in the inconsistencies

## Conclusion

The diagnostic results confirm significant discrepancies between the direct API and search functionality, which likely explains the data integrity issues observed earlier. The direct API failure combined with search success is particularly concerning as it indicates the systems may be fundamentally disconnected or using different data sources.

The search function appears to work correctly after caching is established, but requires a minimum timeout of 20 seconds for reliable operation. This timing information provides valuable context for the intermittent issues observed during our previous validation tests.

These findings strongly suggest that a comprehensive review of the system architecture is needed to ensure consistent behavior between direct API calls and search functionality.

# ADDENDUM 4: Search Quality Analysis and Proposed Solutions (June 26, 2025)

## Search Quality Evaluation

We've conducted an evaluation of the search quality using a specific, technically nuanced query:

**Query**: "get information about single cell multi-omics data for cell communication"

This query encompasses three key technical components:
1. Single-cell resolution
2. Multi-omics integration (e.g., scRNA-seq + ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics)
3. Relevance to cell-cell communication (ligand-receptor interactions, signaling networks)

## Evaluation Results

Our evaluation assessed 10 returned datasets against these criteria, with the following findings:

| Accession  | Single-cell? | Multi-omics? | Cell Comm? | Overall Relevance |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| GSE300584  | ✅          | ❌          | ✅         | High              |
| GSE300564  | ✅          | ✅          | ⚠️         | Medium            |
| GSE300435  | ✅          | ✅          | ✅         | High              |
| GSE300409  | ✅          | ✅          | ⚠️         | Medium            |
| GSE300189  | ✅          | ✅          | ⚠️         | Medium-High       |
| GSE297863  | ❌          | ✅          | ❌         | Low               |
| GSE297700  | ❌          | ❌          | ❌         | Very Low          |
| GSE297319  | ✅          | ⚠️          | ✅         | Medium            |
| GSE296669  | ✅          | ❌          | ⚠️         | Low-Medium        |
| GSE296357  | ✅          | ⚠️          | ✅         | High              |

**Key Findings**:
- Only 3 of 10 results (30%) had high relevance to all three criteria
- 2 of 10 results (20%) had very low or low relevance to the query
- The system consistently returned exactly 10 results, regardless of relevance

## Analysis of Search Quality Issues

The evaluation reveals several critical issues with the search functionality:

1. **Relevance Scoring Problems**:
   - The search algorithm does not properly weight the three technical components in the query
   - Low-relevance results (e.g., GSE297700) rank equally with high-relevance results

2. **Metadata Extraction Issues**:
   - Insufficient or inaccurate extraction of multi-omics information
   - Possible mis-classification of experimental techniques
   - Inconsistent recognition of cell communication contexts

3. **Query Interpretation Limitations**:
   - The system seems unable to properly parse complex, multi-faceted technical queries
   - Boolean logic (AND between technical concepts) may not be functioning correctly

4. **Fixed Result Count Bias**:
   - The system returns exactly 10 results regardless of relevance threshold
   - This suggests either hardcoding or improper pagination/results limiting

## Connection to Previous Findings

These search quality issues align with our previous findings:

1. The search behavior (fixed count of 10 results) matches what we observed in Addendum 1
2. The search relevance issues may explain some of the content mismatches we detected
3. The query interpretation limitations may be related to the timeouts observed in our diagnostics

## Proposed Solutions

Based on this comprehensive analysis, we recommend the following solutions:

### Immediate Fixes:

1. **Relevance Threshold Implementation**:
   - Implement a minimum relevance score threshold for search results
   - Allow variable result counts based on relevance (don't force 10 results)

2. **Metadata Re-extraction and Verification**:
   - Audit and re-extract metadata for common technical terms in omics research
   - Create a verification pipeline to compare extracted metadata against source data

3. **Timeout Optimization**:
   - Implement the 20-second minimum timeout identified in our diagnostics
   - Add graceful degradation for complex queries (return partial results rather than timeout)

### Medium-term Improvements:

1. **Query Parser Enhancement**:
   - Develop a specialized parser for technical omics queries
   - Implement proper handling of multi-faceted technical concepts

2. **Relevance Scoring Refinement**:
   - Weight technical terms appropriately in the relevance algorithm
   - Consider domain-specific boosting for omics terminology

3. **Result Quality Feedback Loop**:
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms for search results
   - Use this feedback to continuously improve relevance scoring

### Long-term Solutions:

1. **Semantic Search Implementation**:
   - Replace or augment keyword-based search with embedding-based semantic search
   - This would better handle conceptual queries and related technical terminology

2. **Domain-Specific Query Understanding**:
   - Develop specialized models for understanding omics research terminology
   - Create a domain-specific ontology for mapping between related concepts

3. **Infrastructure Redesign**:
   - Address the disconnect between direct API and search backends
   - Implement consistent data access patterns across all system components

## Conclusion

The search quality evaluation confirms and extends our understanding of the data integrity issues in the OmicsOracle system. The problems are not just limited to content mismatches and timeouts, but extend to the fundamental relevance and quality of search results.

We recommend implementing the immediate fixes while developing a comprehensive plan for the medium and long-term solutions. This will ensure both the reliability and the quality of the search functionality, which is critical for researchers using the OmicsOracle system to find relevant omics datasets.
