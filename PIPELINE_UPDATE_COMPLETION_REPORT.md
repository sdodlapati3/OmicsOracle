# Pipeline Update Completion Report

**Date:** June 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Overview

The OmicsOracle pipeline has been successfully updated to use improved entity extraction and search strategies, replacing the old query parsing method. The new implementation leverages the enhanced search service for better dataset discovery and more accurate results.

## Key Updates Implemented

### 1. Pipeline Integration (`src/omics_oracle/pipeline/pipeline.py`)
- **Enhanced Search Service Integration**: The pipeline now uses `ImprovedSearchService` with multiple search strategies
- **Entity Extraction Upgrade**: Integrated with `BiomedicalNER` for better entity recognition
- **Search Method Modernization**: Updated both `process_query` and `search_datasets` methods to use the new search approach

### 2. Search Strategy Improvements
- **Multi-Strategy Approach**: The system now tries multiple search strategies in sequence
- **Enhanced Entity Recognition**: Better identification of experimental techniques, diseases, organisms, and tissues
- **Query Optimization**: Automatic query expansion using synonyms and biomedical knowledge

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- **Seamless Integration**: All existing web interface endpoints continue to work without changes
- **Consistent API**: The `search_datasets` method maintains the same interface while using improved internals
- **Result Format**: Output format remains consistent for existing integrations

## Technical Details

### Updated Components
1. **Main Pipeline Class** (`OmicsOracle`)
   - Integrated `ImprovedSearchService` during initialization
   - Modified `_search_geo_data` method to use new search strategies
   - Enhanced processing steps logging for better debugging

2. **Search Integration**
   - Multiple search strategies: `core_technique_disease`, `technique_only`, etc.
   - Enhanced entity extraction with confidence scores
   - Improved result metadata with strategy details

3. **Entity Processing**
   - Better experimental technique recognition (e.g., DNA methylation, RNA-seq)
   - Enhanced disease and tissue association mapping
   - Improved synonym handling for biomedical terms

## Validation Results

### Test 1: Brain Methylation Cancer Query
```
Query: "brain methylation cancer"
Results:
- ✅ Found 10 GEO IDs using 2 successful strategies
- ✅ Processed 5 datasets with metadata
- ✅ Enhanced entity extraction working correctly
- ✅ Multi-strategy search functioning as expected
```

### Test 2: Heart Disease RNA-seq Query
```
Query: "heart disease RNA-seq"
Results:
- ✅ Found 6 GEO IDs using 1 successful strategy
- ✅ Processed 3 datasets with metadata
- ✅ Enhanced entities found: 11 different types
- ✅ Pipeline integration test: PASSED
```
