- Natural language querying of NCBI GEO database
- Intelligent metadata extraction from unstructured GEO text
- Integration with established GEO tools ecosystem
- Ontology-aware biological term mapping

### 2. **Architecture Completely Redesigned**
**Before**: Generic AI pipeline with unclear data sources
**After**: Specific modular pipeline matching the architecture document:
```
Natural Language Query ‚Üí Prompt Interpreter ‚Üí Ontology Mapper ‚Üí Query Builder
                                                                       ‚Üì
Output Formatter ‚Üê Summarizer ‚Üê Metadata Aggregator ‚Üê Retriever ‚Üê Structured Query
```

### 3. **Technology Stack Updated**
**Major Additions**:
- **GEO-Specific Tools**: Entrezpy, GEOparse, pysradb, GEOfetch, GEOmetadb
- **Biomedical NLP**: spaCy + SciSpaCy for biomedical entity recognition
- **Ontology Integration**: MeSH, Disease Ontology, Uberon, NCBI Taxonomy
- **NCBI API Integration**: E-utilities with proper rate limiting

**Removed Generic Components**:
- Generic "multi-format data loaders"
- Vague "pattern recognition algorithms"
- Generic "data visualization" components

### 4. **Development Phases Restructured**
**Before**: 7 generic phases focusing on general AI development
**After**: 4 focused phases following the MVP roadmap:

1. **Phase 1**: Core Search and Retrieval (Weeks 1-4)
2. **Phase 2**: Enrichment and Robustness (Weeks 5-8)
3. **Phase 3**: API and Summarization (Weeks 9-12)
4. **Phase 4**: Production Deployment (Weeks 13-15)

### 5. **Project Structure Specialized**
**New GEO-Specific Modules**:
- `geo_tools/` - Integration layer for all GEO libraries
- `core/prompt_interpreter.py` - Natural language query parsing
- `core/ontology_mapper.py` - Biological term normalization
- `core/query_builder.py` - Entrez query construction
- `core/retriever.py` - Multi-tool GEO data retrieval
- `core/aggregator.py` - Metadata consolidation
- `core/summarizer.py` - LLM-based summarization

### 6. **Success Metrics Made Specific**
**Before**: Generic metrics like "process 1000+ datasets"
**After**: GEO-specific metrics:
- Parse natural language queries with 95%+ accuracy in term extraction
- Successfully parse and summarize 1000+ GEO series (GSE)
- Handle all major functional genomics data types (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, WGBS, ATAC-seq)
- Map 90%+ of biological terms to controlled vocabularies

### 7. **MVP Roadmap Added**
**New Section**: Detailed week-by-week roadmap directly from the architecture document:
- **Phase 1**: Basic keyword matching and GEO retrieval
- **Phase 2**: Advanced NLP and ontology mapping
- **Phase 3**: Production API with LLM summarization
- **Phase 4**: Deployment and documentation

## üöÄ Implementation Impact

### Immediate Next Steps (Changed)
**Before**: Generic "set up development environment"
**After**: Specific GEO tools setup:
1. Install and configure Entrezpy, GEOparse, pysradb, GEOfetch
2. Set up spaCy with SciSpaCy biomedical models
3. Download and configure ontology databases (MeSH, Disease Ontology)
4. Test basic GEO API connectivity and rate limiting

### Technology Learning Path (New)
Team members now need to learn:
- **GEO Database Structure**: Understanding GSE, GSM, GPL hierarchies
- **NCBI E-utilities**: Proper query construction and API usage
- **Biomedical Ontologies**: MeSH, Disease Ontology, Uberon navigation
- **Genomics Assay Types**: WGBS, RRBS, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq characteristics
- **Scientific Text Processing**: Handling unstructured experimental descriptions

### Risk Mitigation (Updated)
**New Risks Identified**:
- NCBI API rate limiting and reliability
- Complexity of biomedical ontology integration
- Quality variations in GEO metadata across experiments
- Performance challenges with large-scale metadata processing

## üìä Project Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths Confirmed
