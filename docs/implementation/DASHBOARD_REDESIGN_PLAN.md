# 🧬 OmicsOracle Dashboard Redesign Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 23, 2025
**Purpose:** Transform the current generic analytics dashboard into a research-focused discovery platform

---

## 🎯 **DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**

### **Core Principle: Research Discovery Accelerator**

The dashboard should serve as a **research intelligence platform** that helps scientists:
- Discover research trends and opportunities
- Understand the genomics data landscape
- Make informed experimental design decisions
- Track their research domain evolution over time

**NOT a system monitoring tool, but a research insights platform.**

---

## 🔍 **CRITICAL EVALUATION OF CURRENT DASHBOARD**

### **Current Problems:**

1. **❌ Generic Analytics Focus**
   - Shows system metrics instead of research insights
   - Charts display technical data (response times, entity counts)
   - No connection to scientific research workflows

2. **❌ Poor User-Researcher Alignment**
   - Target users are researchers/bioinformaticians, not system admins
   - Current widgets serve operational needs, not research needs
   - Missing integration with core AI-powered features

3. **❌ Technical Disconnection**
   - Dashboard operates independently from main pipeline
   - No real-time integration with search/analysis results
   - Mock data instead of live research insights

4. **❌ Inflexible Architecture**
   - Hard-coded for generic metrics
   - Cannot adapt to different research domains
   - Static layout unsuitable for evolving research needs

    @abstractmethod
    def render_config(self) -> WidgetConfig:
        """Define widget appearance and behavior"""
        pass

class ResearchDomainMapWidget(ResearchWidget):
    """Interactive network of research relationships"""

    def get_data(self, context: ResearchContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Use AI pipeline to extract entity relationships
