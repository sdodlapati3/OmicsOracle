## Overview

The OmicsOracle advanced search system builds upon the foundation of the enhanced query handler to provide a more sophisticated and user-friendly search experience. The key components include:

- **Semantic Ranking**: Ranks search results based on biomedical relevance to the query
- **Result Clustering**: Groups results into meaningful categories based on metadata
- **Query Reformulation**: Suggests alternative query formulations to guide users
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks search system performance metrics
- **Error Analysis**: Identifies patterns in errors to guide improvements

These components work together to provide a more effective search experience for biomedical data.

## Semantic Ranking

### Purpose

Traditional keyword-based search can return results that match the query terms but lack relevance to the user's intent. Semantic ranking addresses this by scoring results based on their biomedical significance to the query.

### Implementation

The semantic ranking system works through the following process:

1. **Concept Extraction**: The system extracts biomedical concepts from the query, including:
   - Disease terms (e.g., cancer, diabetes)
   - Tissue types (e.g., liver, brain)
   - Organisms (e.g., human, mouse)
   - Data types (e.g., RNA-seq, microarray)

2. **Relevance Scoring**: Each search result is scored based on:
   - Presence of query concepts in the result
   - Importance weights of matched concepts
   - Context of the matched concepts

3. **Result Re-ranking**: Results are re-ordered based on their semantic scores, bringing the most relevant results to the top.

### Example

For a query like "human liver cancer RNA-seq":

```python
# Extracted concepts
concepts = [
    {"text": "human", "type": "organism", "importance": 0.6},
    {"text": "liver", "type": "tissue", "importance": 0.7},
    {"text": "cancer", "type": "disease", "importance": 1.0},
    {"text": "RNA-seq", "type": "data_type", "importance": 0.9}
]

# Each result is scored based on these concepts
# Results with exact matches for high-importance concepts (cancer, RNA-seq)
# will score higher than results with only partial matches
```

## Result Clustering

### Purpose

When a search returns many results, users can be overwhelmed. Result clustering helps by organizing results into logical groups based on their properties, making it easier to navigate large result sets.

### Implementation

The clustering system follows these steps:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts clustering features from results, including:
   - Organism type (human, mouse, etc.)
   - Tissue type (liver, brain, etc.)
   - Disease condition (cancer, diabetes, etc.)
   - Data type (RNA-seq, microarray, etc.)
   - Study type (expression profiling, methylation, etc.)

2. **Cluster Identification**: Identifies potential clusters based on feature frequency and significance.

3. **Result Assignment**: Assigns each result to one or more relevant clusters.

4. **Cluster Labeling**: Generates human-readable labels for each cluster.

### Example

A search for "cancer methylation" might produce these clusters:

- **Human Studies (15 results)**
- **Breast Cancer (8 results)**
- **Lung Cancer (7 results)**
- **Methylation Array (12 results)**
- **Methylation Sequencing (5 results)**

This allows users to quickly focus on specific aspects of interest.

## Query Reformulation

### Purpose

Users often struggle to formulate optimal queries, especially in domain-specific areas like biomedicine. Query reformulation suggests alternative queries that might yield better results.

### Implementation

The query reformulation system:

1. **Query Analysis**: Analyzes the original query for:
   - Missing components (organism, tissue, data type, etc.)
   - General terms that could be more specific
   - Potential ambiguities

2. **Suggestion Generation**: Creates alternative query suggestions based on:
   - Adding missing components (e.g., adding "human" if no organism is specified)
   - Replacing general terms with more specific ones (e.g., "breast cancer" instead of just "cancer")
   - Expanding abbreviations or using alternative terminology

3. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence scores to suggestions based on their likely relevance.

### Example

For a query "brain tumor":

```
Suggested queries:
1. "human brain tumor RNA-seq" (Added organism and data type)
2. "glioblastoma" (More specific tumor type)
3. "brain tumor methylation" (Added data type focus)
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Purpose

To ensure the search system remains fast and efficient, we've implemented a comprehensive performance monitoring system that tracks key metrics and identifies bottlenecks.

### Implementation

The performance monitoring system:

1. **Metric Collection**: Collects performance metrics for each query:
   - Overall response time
   - Component-level timing (parsing, synonym expansion, search execution)
   - Result counts
   - Resource usage (memory, CPU)

2. **Analysis**: Analyzes performance patterns:
   - Average, minimum, and maximum response times
   - Identification of slow components
   - Correlation between query complexity and performance

3. **Visualization**: Generates charts and reports for easy analysis:
   - Response time comparisons
   - Component time breakdowns
   - Performance trends over time

```

## Error Analysis

### Purpose

Understanding and addressing errors is crucial for improving system reliability. The error analysis tool helps identify patterns in errors and provides actionable recommendations.

### Implementation

The error analysis system:

1. **Log Processing**: Parses application logs to extract error entries.

2. **Error Categorization**: Categorizes errors based on patterns:
   - Connection timeouts
   - API rate limits
   - Parsing errors
   - Data not found
   - Server errors
   - Memory issues

3. **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies trends and common issues:
   - Frequency of error types
   - Error distribution over time
   - Components with the most errors

4. **Recommendation Generation**: Provides actionable recommendations for addressing common issues.

### Example Output
