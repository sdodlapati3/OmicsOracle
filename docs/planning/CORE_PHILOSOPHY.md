def process_geo_metadata(data: Dict) -> ProcessedMetadata:
    """Process GEO metadata with validation.

    Args:
        data: Raw GEO metadata dictionary

    Returns:
        ProcessedMetadata: Validated and structured metadata

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If data fails quality checks
    """
    validate_input_data(data)
    result = _process_metadata(data)
    validate_output_quality(result)
    return result
```

### 2. Reliability & Robustness

class OntologyMapper(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for ontology mapping services."""

    @abstractmethod
    def map_term(self, term: str, context: str) -> MappingResult:
        """Map a term to controlled vocabulary."""
        pass

class MeSHMapper(OntologyMapper):
    """MeSH-specific implementation."""

    def map_term(self, term: str, context: str) -> MappingResult:
        # MeSH-specific mapping logic

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance Framework

### Code Quality Standards

#### 1. Code Style & Formatting
- **Black** for Python code formatting (88-character line length)
- **isort** for import organization
- **mypy** for static type checking (strict mode)
- **flake8** for linting with custom genomics rules
- **ASCII-Only Code Policy**: Strict enforcement of ASCII characters (0x00-0x7F) in all code, scripts, configurations, and commit messages
- **Special Character Policy**: Emojis and Unicode symbols allowed ONLY in markdown documentation files (.md, .rst)
- **Enforcement System**: Automated pre-commit hooks and CI/CD checks prevent non-ASCII characters in code files
- **Character Replacement Guidelines**: Use ASCII alternatives (e.g., [PASS] instead of ✅, [FAIL] instead of ❌)
- **Documentation Exception**: Unicode content permitted in docs/, README files, and .md/.rst files for scientific notation
- **Rationale**: Prevents CI/CD failures, ensures cross-platform compatibility, and maintains terminal/shell reliability
- **docstring** coverage minimum 95%

) -> QueryResult:
    """Query GEO metadata using natural language.

    This function implements the core OmicsOracle pipeline:
    1. Parse natural language query using NLP models
    2. Map biological terms to controlled vocabularies
    3. Construct optimized Entrez queries
    4. Retrieve and aggregate metadata from multiple sources
    5. Generate structured results with quality metrics

    Args:
        query: Natural language query (e.g., "WGBS data in human brain")
        filters: Optional additional filters for refinement
        max_results: Maximum number of GEO series to return

    Returns:
        QueryResult containing:
            - matched_series: List of GEO series with metadata
            - query_metrics: Processing time, confidence scores
            - suggestions: Related queries and improvements

    Raises:
        QueryParsingError: If natural language query cannot be parsed
        GEOAPIError: If GEO database access fails
        ValidationError: If results fail quality validation

    Example:
        >>> result = query_geo_metadata("WGBS brain cancer human")
        >>> print(f"Found {len(result.matched_series)} series")
        >>> for series in result.matched_series:

## 🔒 ASCII-Only Code Policy (Critical)

### Rationale & Benefits
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensures code works identically on all operating systems
- **CI/CD reliability**: Prevents pipeline failures due to character encoding issues
- **Terminal compatibility**: Works in all shell environments and terminal emulators
- **Git workflow stability**: Avoids merge conflicts and encoding problems
- **International collaboration**: ASCII works universally across all locales
- **Scientific reproducibility**: Ensures consistent behavior in all environments

### Implementation
- **Automated enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD checks prevent violations
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All code, scripts, configs, and commit messages
- **Exception handling**: Unicode allowed ONLY in markdown documentation (.md/.rst files)
- **Character replacement**: Detailed ASCII alternatives for common Unicode symbols
- **Error reporting**: Clear violation messages with specific character codes and locations

### ASCII Replacement Examples
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Unicode symbols
# ✅ Function works perfectly!
temperature = 25°C
α = 0.05

# ✅ CORRECT - ASCII alternatives
# [OK] Function works perfectly!
temperature = "25degC"
alpha = 0.05
```

**Reference**: See `docs/ASCII_ENFORCEMENT_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive replacement tables and examples.
