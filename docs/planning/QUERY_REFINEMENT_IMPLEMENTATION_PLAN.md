## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive, step-wise implementation plan for integrating robust query refinement mechanisms into OmicsOracle. The goal is to help users receive better search results through actionable suggestions, alternative queries, and interactive feedback.

## Current System Analysis
- ✅ Backend performs entity extraction and synonym-based query expansion
- ✅ Frontend displays search results with basic interface
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: User-facing suggestions when queries return no results
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Interactive refinement mechanism
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Feedback loop for query improvement

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Conduct final validation
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor initial usage and performance

## Success Metrics
- Increase in successful search sessions (target: +25%)
- Reduction in zero-result queries (target: -40%)
- User engagement with refinement suggestions (target: >60%)
- Query refinement success rate (target: >70%)

## Risk Mitigation
