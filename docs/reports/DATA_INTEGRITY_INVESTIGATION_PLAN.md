# OmicsOracle Data Integrity Investigation Plan

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Severe data mapping error where GSE ID (GSE278726) is completely mismatched with the displayed title, summary, and content. The GSE ID refers to a yeast NatE acetylation study, but the displayed content is about COVID-19 cardiac dysfunction research.

This represents a **fundamental data integrity failure** that could undermine user trust and scientific accuracy.

## Problem Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **GSE ID Mismatch**: GSE278726 (yeast study) vs COVID-19 cardiac organoid content
2. **Data Source Corruption**: Wrong metadata being associated with wrong datasets
3. **Pipeline Integrity Failure**: Data validation and verification processes are failing
4. **Content Attribution Error**: Correct scientific content but wrong dataset reference

### Impact Assessment

- [ ] Check for race conditions or concurrency issues
- [ ] Identify logical errors in data flow
- [ ] Review error handling and validation code

#### 4.2 Architecture Analysis
- [ ] Review data architecture for design flaws
- [ ] Check for improper data relationships
- [ ] Identify missing validation layers
- [ ] Review caching and storage architecture

#### 4.3 Historical Analysis
- [ ] Check when this issue first appeared
- [ ] Review recent code changes that might have caused this
- [ ] Identify if this is a regression or long-standing issue
- [ ] Analyze error logs and monitoring data

## Technical Investigation Areas

### 1. Data Source Verification
```bash
