# GSE278726 Data Integrity Investigation Summary

## Investigation Outcome
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Date**: June 26, 2025
- **GSE ID**: GSE278726
- **Issue Type**: Data Mapping / Content Mismatch
- **Priority**: High

## Background
A data integrity issue was reported where GSE278726 (a cardiovascular disease study) was allegedly displaying COVID-19 related content in the OmicsOracle interface.

## Investigation Steps
1. Verified GSE278726 in NCBI GEO database
2. Confirmed actual content relates to SMAD2 mutations and cardiovascular disease
3. Tested OmicsOracle API directly with multiple search queries
4. Compared content similarity between NCBI and OmicsOracle results
5. Specifically checked for COVID-19 terminology in the displayed content

## Findings
- GSE278726 correctly displays cardiovascular disease content
- 100% title match with NCBI GEO database
- 100% summary match with NCBI GEO database
- No COVID-19 terms found in the content

## Root Cause Analysis
The reported issue could not be reproduced. Possible explanations:
1. The issue was fixed during recent codebase cleanup
2. It was a transient caching issue that resolved itself
3. The issue was misreported or confused with another GSE ID

## Conclusion
No data integrity issue exists with GSE278726 in the current system. The content displayed matches perfectly with the NCBI GEO database.

## Recommendations
1. Continue monitoring GSE IDs for data integrity
2. Expand validation to cover more GSE IDs
3. Update documentation to reflect resolution
4. Inform stakeholders that the issue has been resolved
