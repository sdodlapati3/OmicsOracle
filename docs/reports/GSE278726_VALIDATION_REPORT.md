# GSE278726 Data Integrity Validation Report

**Date:** June 26, 2025
**Issue Investigated:** Reported mismatch between GSE278726 and displayed content (COVID-19 related content)
**Validation Status:** âœ… RESOLVED / NOT REPRODUCED

## Executive Summary

Our investigation found no evidence that GSE278726 is displaying COVID-19 related content in the OmicsOracle interface. When directly queried, GSE278726 correctly displays its actual content from NCBI GEO about SMAD2 mutations and cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.

## Investigation Methodology

1. **Direct NCBI GEO Validation**: We validated GSE278726 directly against NCBI GEO using multiple APIs to confirm its actual content
2. **Direct OmicsOracle Query**: We directly queried GSE278726 in the OmicsOracle interface
3. **Cross-Reference Testing**: We tested if GSE278726 appears in COVID-19 related searches
4. **Content Analysis**: We analyzed the displayed content for GSE278726 for any mention of COVID-19 terms

## Findings

### NCBI GEO Data (Ground Truth)
- **GSE ID:** GSE278726
- **Title:** "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"
- **Content Type:** ATAC-Seq data related to cardiovascular disease
- **Contains COVID-19 Terms:** No

### OmicsOracle Display
- **GSE ID:** GSE278726
- **Title Displayed:** "Modeling SMAD2 mutations in iPSCs provides insights into cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. [ATAC-Seq]"
- **Content Type Displayed:** Cardiovascular disease research data
- **Contains COVID-19 Terms:** No

### Search Cross-Reference
- GSE278726 was found when directly searching for it by ID
- GSE278726 was NOT found when searching for "COVID-19" related terms
- The system appears to correctly map the GSE ID to its proper content

## Conclusion

**No data integrity issue detected for GSE278726.** The OmicsOracle system correctly displays the appropriate title and content for this GSE ID, which relates to cardiovascular disease research using ATAC-Seq, not COVID-19. This suggests that either:

1. The reported issue has been resolved in a previous code cleanup
2. The issue was misreported or was observed in a different context
3. The issue might have been related to a temporary cache or server state that has since been cleared

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Monitoring**: While this specific case is resolved, continue to monitor for any other potential GSE ID mismatches
2. **Update Documentation**: Update project documentation to note that GSE278726 has been validated and does not display COVID-19 content
3. **User Communication**: Inform stakeholders that the reported issue with GSE278726 has been addressed or could not be reproduced
4. **Extended Testing**: Consider running broader validation tests on a larger sample of GSE IDs to ensure overall data integrity

## Validation Tests

The following validation scripts were used:
- `validate_gse_content.py` - Compares GSE content against NCBI GEO
- `direct_gse_check.py` - Tests direct GSE ID searches in the OmicsOracle interface
