## How to Update Documentation

### For Technical Documentation

The technical documentation should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the search system architecture or components. When updating:

1. Clearly mark new or changed sections
2. Update the "Last Updated" date
3. Increment the document version number
4. Add a changelog entry if needed

### For Case Study Documentation

The case study should be updated when:

1. New significant use cases emerge
2. Important improvements to the system change how it handles queries
3. New lessons are learned from real-world usage

### Process for Documentation Updates

1. Create a branch for documentation updates
2. Make changes to relevant documents
3. Have changes reviewed by at least one other team member
4. Merge documentation updates with code changes when appropriate

Remember that good documentation is crucial for maintaining and extending the system over time.
