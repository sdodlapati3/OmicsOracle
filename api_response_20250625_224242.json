      "summary": "The absolute number of rDNA transcription units can vary by about one power of ten among individuals. Apart from extensive rDNA copy number (CN) variation and instability in many cancers, there is little information on the extent of intraindividual CN variation between normal s. Here we used droplet digital PCR and deep bisulfite sequencing to determine both the absolute rDNA CN and the number of presumably active CN with a hypomethylated (0-10%) promoter region in up to six different s of 13 autopsy probands. In general, the absolute rDNA CN as well as the frequency of the minor A variant were highly similar between s (cerebellum, cerebrum, colon, heart, intestine, kidney, and liver  liver and spleen) of the same individual. However, in some probands absolute CN in one or multiple s was much higher than in the other s., consistent with relaxation/breakdown of the CN control system. The amplified copies were inactivated by promoter methylation and, thus, the number of active CN was largely independent from absolute CN. Collectively, our data suggest that with some notable exceptions absolute and even more active rDNA CN are maintained during development and differentiation in different s of the same individual. Despite the low intraindividual variation active CN appeared to systematically vary between s. Cerebellum, which is characterized by the highest density of non-dividing neuronal cells in the body, consistently exhibited lower active CN than other s. We estimate that a minimum number of > 50 active rDNA TU is required for normal /organ function.",

The concordance between the two EPIC versions in DNA methylation-based tools has not yet been investigated. To address this, DNA methylation was profiled on both versions using matched blood samples across four cohorts spanning early to late adulthood. High concordance between versions at the array level but variable agreement at the individual probe level was noted. A significant contribution of EPIC version to DNA methylation variation was observed, though it was to a smaller extent compared to sample relatedness and cell type composition. Modest but significant differences in DNA methylation-based estimates between versions were observed, irrespective of the data preprocessing method used. Adjustments for EPIC version or calculation of estimates separately for each version largely mitigated these version-specific discordances. This work emphasizes the importance of accounting for EPIC version differences in research scenarios, especially in meta-analyses and longitudinal studies that require data harmonization across versions.",

Existing single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (scWGBS) methods2 have substantial shortcomings, including very low CpG coverage3\u20137 or inefficient library generation requiring extremely deep sequencing.8 We report an improved method, single-cell Deep and Efficient Epigenomic Profiling of methyl-C (scDEEP-mC). High-coverage DNA methylation profiling by scDEEP-mC allows cell type identification, genome-wide profiling of hemi-methylation, and allele-resolved analysis of X-inactivation epigenetics in single cells. We further demonstrate how scDEEP-mC can profile single-cell copy number alterations, identify replicating cells, and track DNA methylation dynamics during and after DNA replication.

Disrupting ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy in murine and patient-derived DMG models, increasing survival. Microscopy-based in situ sequencing was used to spatially resolve transcriptional profiles in >750,000 single cells with or without ATM disruption and radiation therapy, revealing altered immune-neoplastic and endothelial cell interactions after treatment. An allelic series of primary murine DMG models with different p53 mutations confirmed that transactivation-independent p53 activity is a key mediator of radiosensitivity after ATM disruption. Our findings contribute primary DMG mouse models with deep profiling and reveal the mechanisms of treatment response to an actionable therapeutic strategy.",

      "summary": "Maintaining genome integrity is crucial for the proper functioning and development of organisms. One intriguing aspect of genome integrity is the formation and function of neocentromeres at non-centromeric sites. The centromere-specific protein CENP-A plays a vital role in centromere identification and function. However, in many cancers, CENP-A is often found to be ectopically misplaced when overexpressed. Moreover, the deposition of CENP-A at the centromere depends on the transcription of centromeric non-coding RNAs. Consequently, ectopic CENP-A is found at transcriptionally active and frequent breakpoint regions. To further explore the ectopic CENP-A localization, we engineered a stable ectopic CENP-A site at a na\u00efve chromosome by overexpressing a non-centromeric oncogenic lncRNA capable of recruiting CENP-A to its transcription site. We tracked cells carrying the stable transgene to understand the stability and longevity of the induced ectopic CENP-A site and the harboring chromosome. Our findings revealed that the induced epigenetic memory was eventually lost by suppression of the transgene through competing epigenetic silencing mechanisms. This epigenetic restoration naturally reversed the ectopic CENP-A level to its previous levels at the engineered site. Our observations suggest that cells may have evolved failsafe mechanisms to prevent neocentromere formation at ectopic sites unless otherwise favored by selection involving multiple components.",
