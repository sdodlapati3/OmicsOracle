          "summary": "The Integrator complex (INT) is an essential regulator of RNA biogenesis across evolution. Most current findings describe INT\u2019s function in states of equilibrium, presenting a research gap in INT\u2019s role in dynamic states, such as in infections and cancers. Viruses hijack cellular RNA machinery to transcribe their genes and produce viral progeny, presenting a unique condition to investigate INT-dependent RNA regulation under perturbation. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic DNA virus that causes two deadly cancers, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. KSHV undergoes a highly regulated and robust transcription of viral genes upon lytic reactivation, providing a complex and dynamic system to investigate Integrator-mediated viral/host RNA metabolism.  We find that Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11), the enzymatic core of INT, is required for an optimal KSHV lytic lifecycle following reactivation from latency or after primary infection. While INTS11 knockdown\u2019s impact on the human transcriptome remains bi-directional, it almost exclusively represses the KSHV transcriptome throughout the lytic stages. This inhibits viral protein expression, viral genome replication, and virion production. Integrator subunits 9 and 6 are also important for the KSHV lytic lifecycle. RNA-seq analyses revealed dynamic and unique signatures of human transcriptomes during each latent or lytic stage. Mechanistically, ChIP-seq analysis showed that INTS11 is broadly and increasingly recruited to the KSHV genome with unique binding site specificities as the lytic cycle progresses, suggesting that KSHV hijacks INTS11 to facilitate its lytic lifecycle. These findings reveal unexpected and critical roles of the Integrator complex in the lytic phase of KSHV infection.",

          "title": "Cross-talk between Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells in heterotypic clusters",
          "summary": "Circulating Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (cCAFs) have been discovered in circulating tumor cell clusters from all stages of disease progression in breast cancer patients. As the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME), CAFs impart many of the tumor promoting functions defined by the hallmarks of cancer such as: proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, stemness, immunosuppression, altered cancer cell metabolism, and drug resistance. Human primary CAF cell lines can form co-clusters in vitro with human breast cancer cells when grown in ultra-low attachment conditions. We have previously used these co-clusters to show that they promote metastasis in the mouse tail vein model. In this study, we seek to understand the cross-talk that occurs between CAFs and TNBC  cells when they are present in heterotypic co-clusters compared to TNBC monoclusters or CAF monoclusters. We created samples of mono-clusters and co-clusters grown in 3D conditions for 48 hrs, then disrupted the clusters into a single cell suspension, and subsequently processed them for Single-cell RNA sequencing. Comparisons of breast cancer cells grown as mono-clusters versus co-clusters revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are up and down regulated in the presence of CAFs. Integration Pathway Analysis and Gene Ontology analysis revealed that CAFs increase expression of several components of the fibrinolysis pathway in breast cancer cells, such as uPA/PLAU and SERPINE1. Upstream regulators identified included TGFbeta. We also looked at DEGs in CAFs when in co-clusters versus mono-clusters and found that when in co-clusters, CAFs become even more CAF-like with the upregulation of genes such as collagens, integrins, and FN1. This study provided us with candidates to study in the process of CAF-mediated breast cancer cell extravasation, such as uPA/PLAU. Pathways identified support our conclusions that circulating CAFs are important players in the metastatic process.",

          "summary": "Infarct-induced neurodegeneration increases dementia risk for at least a decade in humans. It can be modeled in wildtype mice, where a cortical stroke results in chronic lymphocytic infiltration into the infarct and delayed cognitive decline. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on endothelial cells is increased by stroke and facilitates immune cell diapedesis by binding very late antigen 4 (VLA4) on immune cells. We report here that after stroke, chronic but not acute treatment with an anti-VCAM1 blocking antibody reduces B and T lymphocyte infiltration and prevents chronic cognitive dysfunction in wildtype male and female mice. Preservation of cognitive function was also seen with chronic anti-VLA4 treatment despite anti-VLA4\u2019s lack of effect on lymphocyte infiltration. High-depth single-cell RNA sequencing of the chronic infarct and peri-infarct cortex revealed a pronounced decrease in expression of blood vessel growth and maturation genes in endothelial cells that was reversed by both anti-VLA4 and anti-VCAM1. Plasma proteomics also support a vasculoprotective mechanism of anti-VCAM1. Finally, immunostaining demonstrated that both antibodies improve pericyte coverage of the vasculature and prevent extravascular fibrinogen leakage. Together, our findings indicate that vascular structure and function remain abnormal long after stroke and that the VLA4/VCAM1 axis is a promising treatment target for infarct-induced neurodegeneration as blockade restores cerebrovasculature and prevents cognitive decline.",

          "summary": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common adult primary intraocular malignancy, with a strong predilection for hepatic metastasis, occurring in approximately 50% of cases. Metastatic UM remains highly resistant to therapy and is almost invariably fatal. The strongest genetic driver of UM metastasis is loss of function of the tumor suppressor BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1), which leads to widespread epigenetic dysregulation. To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we investigated whether targeting the epigenome could reveal new vulnerabilities in UM. We performed high-throughput compound screening using a curated epigenetic inhibitor library and identified BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain) inhibition as a particularly promising approach. While previous clinical trials with BET inhibitors for UM treatment have failed clinically, we found substantial heterogeneity in the efficacy of different BET inhibitors in UM. Notably, the BET inhibitor mivebresib (ABBV-075) significantly improved survival rates by 50% in a metastatic UM xenograft mouse model and prevented detectable metastases in the bones, spinal cord, and brain. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a strong overlap between BET inhibition and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition-- an approach currently under clinical evaluation for UM treatment. BET and HDAC inhibitors reversed gene expression signatures associated with high metastatic risk and induced a neuron-like phenotype in UM cells. These findings establish BET inhibition as a potent and previously underappreciated vulnerability for metastatic UM.",
