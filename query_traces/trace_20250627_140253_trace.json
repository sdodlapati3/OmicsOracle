              "summary": "Myeloid cells including brain-resident macrophages (microglia) and peripheral macrophages play a crucial role in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). They adapt to extracellular stimuli by acquiring various transcriptional states. Understanding of how these states are regulated is limited due to a lack of tools that enable robust reprogramming toward disease-associated phenotypes. In this study, we investigated the effects of a cytokine mix, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1/M-CSF), interleukin 34 (IL-34) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2), on human THP-1 macrophages to elucidate their potential reprogramming towards disease-associated phenotypes and subsequential functional changes. Our results indicate that treatment with the cytokine mix led to significant transcriptomic changes, driving human THP-1 macrophages towards a transcriptional state reminiscent of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM) collectively referred to as DLAM. Transcriptome profiling revealed gene expression changes related to oxidative phosphorylation, lysosome function, and lipid metabolism. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the activation of DLAM-like transcriptional responses across multiple cell clusters. Functional assays demonstrated alterations in macrophage motility, phagocytosis, lysosomal activity, and metabolic and energetic profiles. Our findings provide insights into the cytokine-mediated reprogramming of macrophages towards disease-relevant states, highlighting their role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential for therapeutic development.",

              "summary": "In recent decades, transcriptome analysis has been widely used to understand human disease pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Accumulated reports in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, have also provided evidence of dysregulated gene expression related to neuropathogenesis. However, obtaining samples from neurodegenerative patients is more challenging than other human diseases due to low accessibility. Also, brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid are composed of multiple cell types, so they are unsuitable for obtaining neural cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Thus, we here report gene expression profiles in primary neuronal cultures exposed to A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity to understand pathological gene expression in neurons. By RNA-sequencing analysis, we compare transcriptomes and find that two groups of genes show similar expression patterns in A\u03b2 toxicity excitotoxicity\u2014they are either up- or down-regulated in both conditions. Genes in the two groups are related to synaptic function and cell signaling, which are well-known biological functions altered in A\u03b2 toxicity and excitotoxicity. Interestingly, the analysis reveals a possibility that circadian clock (molecular oscillator generating daily rhythms)-related genes are dysregulated in both conditions. We confirm the reduced circadian transcription factor Bmal1 levels in A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity. RNA-sequencing analysis in Bmal1-deleted neurons shows potential relationships between BMAL1 and synaptic functions. Thus, this transcriptome study provides evidence of the potential roles of the circadian clock in neuropathogenesis.",

              "summary": "TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. TREM2 is a cell surface receptor on microglia that regulates homeostatic and immunomodulatory functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic debris and the resolution of damage-associated inflammation. It remains unclear how TREM2 may mediate an influence on neurodegenerative disease, particularly in relation to key neuropathological hallmarks such as neuronal loss and proteinopathy.  We used the ME7 prion disease model to assess the role of TREM2 in the progression and pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Prion diseases are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein and provide a highly tractable platform to determine if TREM2 has disease-modifying effects. Trem2-/- and wild type mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions and effects on CNS disease pathogenesis determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy that alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.",

              "summary": "The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.",

              "summary": "Aging is the primary risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, primarily attributed to progressive changes in cellular epigenomes. Despite this known association, the complexity of the mammalian brain complicates the identification of brain regions and cell types that are most susceptible to aging effects. While alterations in gene expression have been observed in aging neural cells, comprehension of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the transcriptomic changes remains largely elusive.  To unveil these complexities in a comprehensive manner, we utilized single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic sequencing (snm3C-seq) to produce extensive datasets comprising 132,551 methylomes and 72,666 chromatin conformation-methylome joint profiles from eight distinct brain regions of C57BL/6J mice aged 2, 9, and 18 months. These regions include the anterior hippocampus (AHC), posterior hippocampus (PHC), frontal cortex (FC), amygdala (AMY), nucleus accumbens (NACB), PAG/PCG, entorhinal cortex (ENT), and caudate putamen (CP). We utilized this dataset to investigate age-related changes in DNA methylomes and transcription factor motifs potentially affected by methylation alterations. We also examined methylation changes in transposable elements, observing locus-specific retrotransposon activation. At the chromatin conformation level, we analyzed aging-related changes in compartmentalization, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops. Furthermore, we explored regional heterogeneity during aging within identical cell types and validated our findings using the MERFISH dataset.",
              "overall_design": "C57BL/6J (males and females) mice of different ages were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and maintained in the Salk animal barrier facility on 12-hour dark-light cycles with food ad-libitum for up to 4 weeks (Housing condition: Temperature: 21-23 \u00b0C, relative humidity: 61-63%). Brains were extracted, sliced, and dissected in an ice-cold dissection buffer as previously described (Liu et. al. 2021). Females were synchronized for their estrous cycle by exposing them to male bedding for three days, and collected during diestrus. For snmC-seq3 and snm3C-seq samples, brains were sliced coronally at 600 \u03bcm intervals from the frontal pole across the whole brain, yielding 18 slices, and dissected brain regions were obtained according to the Allen Brain Reference Atlas Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) as previously described (Liu et. al. 2023). For nuclei isolation, each region was dissected from 2-7 animals and pooled to make 2-3 biological replicates. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. We empirically determined to use two to three biological experiments for all single-cell epigenomic experiments to achieve minimum reproducibility for this large-scale project. Blinding and randomization is not performed during handling the tissue samples. Additionally, all dissected regions were digitally registered into CCFv3 using ITK-SNAP60 (v4.0.0) at a 25 \u03bcm resolution.",

              "summary": "In the context of neurodegeneration, activated microglia facilitate inflammation via secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q. Astrocytes exposed to this signaling array polarize to a reactive inflammatory phenotype, termed A1 or A1-like. Astrocytes are essential for neuronal survival, synaptic support, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, but A1-like astrocytes upregulate inflammatory gene expression, downregulate neurotrophic factors, and secrete neurotoxic signals. The consequences of A1-like polarization on BBB function are unknown but may have etiological implications for some diseases. Frequently identified by upregulation of complement component 3 (C3), A1-like astrocytes have been characterized in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with polarization correlated with disease progression and severity. However, the role of A1-like astrocytes in neurodegeneration associated with chronic viral infections, like HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), remains unclear. An in vitro system using primary human astrocytes, as well as a BBB model featuring primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) co-cultured with astrocytes, was used to elucidate cellular and molecular consequences of chronic astrocyte activation. As measured by whole transcriptome analysis and protein expression assays, repeated treatment with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q induced A1-like polarization of astrocytes both in monoculture and in a BBB model, resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory signals. No substantial change to BBB permeability was observed. In contrast, exposure to HIV-1 viral protein Tat did not independently induce A1-like polarization. Ongoing investigations into the effect of astrocyte polarization on BBB integrity and treatment with pathogenic proteins may provide insights into the role of neurotoxic astrocytes in neuroviral pathologies.",
              "overall_design": "To study these facets of astrocyte reactivity, an in vitro model of pro-inflammatory astrocyte polarization was developed using primary human fetal cells, both in monoculture and in a co-culture BBB model. An array of analyses, from RNA transcriptional profiles to changes in signal secretion, were used to characterize an A1-like phenotype in stimulated primary human astrocytes.",

However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis -expression QTLs (eQTLs). Together, we provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic database of the human microglia responsome.",

              "summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neuron death due to nuclear loss and cytoplasmic aggregation of the splice factor TDP-43. Pathologic TDP-43 associates with stress granules (SGs) and downregulating the SG-associated protein Ataxin-2 (Atxn2) using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) prolongs survival in the TAR4/4 sporadic ALS mouse model, a strategy that failed in clinical trials, likely due to inadequate target engagement. Here, we used an AAV with potent motor neuron transduction to deliver optimized Atxn2-targeting miRNAs. Atxn2 knockdown was achieved throughout the central nervous system (CNS) at a dose 40x lower than used in other work. In TAR4/4 mice, miAtxn2 treatment increased mean (54%) and median (45%) survival and robustly improved strength-related measures. There was a corresponding reduction of lower motor neuron death as well as reduced inflammatory markers in both motor cortex and spinal cord, and phosphorylated TDP-43 was reduced to wildtype levels. Transcriptome-wide dysregulation in the TAR4/4 model recapitulated ALS-associated gene signatures that were rescued after Atxn2 reduction, identifying therapeutic mechanisms and potential biomarkers for translation. Additionally, in slow progressing hemizygous mice, treatment slowed disease progression and in ALS patient-derived lower motor neurons, our vector transduced >95% of cells at an MOI 4 logs lower than previously reported for AAV and reduced human ATXN2 in a dose-dependent manner. Cumulatively these data support the utility of AAV-mediated RNAi against Atxn2 as a robust and translatable treatment strategy for sporadic ALS.",

All mice received intravenous injections at P1 with either AAV9-miAtxn2 (TAR4/4 only) or vehicle control. Libraries were indexed and pooled for sequencing at a depth of 60M paired-end reads per sample using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000.",

              "summary": "RNA-mediated toxicity, which can be controlled by alteration of gene expression, is considered a key event in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Transcriptomic deregulation of miRNAs expression can spread via \"horizontal\" RNA transfer through extracellular vesicles (EVs) to act in conjunction with proteins, leading to changes in mRNA, which can provide early signals to indicate forthcoming neuropathological changes in the brain. The aim of this work is to compare expression profiles (obtained by miRNA-seq) from different tissues to highlight commonly expressed and tissue-specific miRNAs. miRNA species from plasma EVs were correlated with miRNA profiles obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Each tissue from ALS patients was compared to controls, revealing 159 deregulated (DE) miRNAs in Exosomes (EXOs), 247 DE miRNAs in PBMCs and 162 DE miRNAs in Microvesicles (MVs). Next, data were filtered to include only miRNAs expressed in disease samples (not in healthy subjects), to reduce the number of tissue- and ALS- specific miRNAs (EXO n=22, MV=11, PBMCs n=8). We identified specific miRNAs and pathways related to each tissue. Interestingly, in PBMCs we found mainly neuro-linked pathways, such as neurotransmitters, brain and neuron development, while in EXOs, we found miRNAs implicated in MAPK and ERB signaling. In contrast, the altered pathways in MVs were not specific. This study shows that the composition of small RNA differs significantly between blood cells and its respective EVs fraction. Differentially expressed miRNAs can target definite transcripts in different cellular and molecular fractions. It is evident that, in terms of miRNAs cargo, MVs are not specific to ALS. Therefore, future studies will focus on the interaction between cells and EXOs.",

Accumulated reports in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, have also provided evidence of dysregulated gene expression related to neuropathogenesis. However, obtaining samples from neurodegenerative patients is more challenging than other human diseases due to low accessibility. Also, brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid are composed of multiple cell types, so they are unsuitable for obtaining neural cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Thus, we here report gene expression profiles in primary neuronal cultures exposed to A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity to understand pathological gene expression in neurons. By RNA-sequencing analysis, we compare transcriptomes and find that two groups of genes show similar expression patterns in A\u03b2 toxicity excitotoxicity\u2014they are either up- or down-regulated in both conditions. Genes in the two groups are related to synaptic function and cell signaling, which are well-known biological functions altered in A\u03b2 toxicity and excitotoxicity. Interestingly, the analysis reveals a possibility that circadian clock (molecular oscillator generating daily rhythms)-related genes are dysregulated in both conditions. We confirm the reduced circadian transcription factor Bmal1 levels in A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity. RNA-sequencing analysis in Bmal1-deleted neurons shows potential relationships between BMAL1 and synaptic functions. Thus, this transcriptome study provides evidence of the potential roles of the circadian clock in neuropathogenesis.",

          "summary": "TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. TREM2 is a cell surface receptor on microglia that regulates homeostatic and immunomodulatory functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic debris and the resolution of damage-associated inflammation. It remains unclear how TREM2 may mediate an influence on neurodegenerative disease, particularly in relation to key neuropathological hallmarks such as neuronal loss and proteinopathy.  We used the ME7 prion disease model to assess the role of TREM2 in the progression and pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Prion diseases are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein and provide a highly tractable platform to determine if TREM2 has disease-modifying effects. Trem2-/- and wild type mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions and effects on CNS disease pathogenesis determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy that alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.",

In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.",

Astrocytes exposed to this signaling array polarize to a reactive inflammatory phenotype, termed A1 or A1-like. Astrocytes are essential for neuronal survival, synaptic support, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, but A1-like astrocytes upregulate inflammatory gene expression, downregulate neurotrophic factors, and secrete neurotoxic signals. The consequences of A1-like polarization on BBB function are unknown but may have etiological implications for some diseases. Frequently identified by upregulation of complement component 3 (C3), A1-like astrocytes have been characterized in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with polarization correlated with disease progression and severity. However, the role of A1-like astrocytes in neurodegeneration associated with chronic viral infections, like HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), remains unclear. An in vitro system using primary human astrocytes, as well as a BBB model featuring primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) co-cultured with astrocytes, was used to elucidate cellular and molecular consequences of chronic astrocyte activation. As measured by whole transcriptome analysis and protein expression assays, repeated treatment with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q induced A1-like polarization of astrocytes both in monoculture and in a BBB model, resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory signals. No substantial change to BBB permeability was observed. In contrast, exposure to HIV-1 viral protein Tat did not independently induce A1-like polarization.

          "summary": "RNA-mediated toxicity, which can be controlled by alteration of gene expression, is considered a key event in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Transcriptomic deregulation of miRNAs expression can spread via \"horizontal\" RNA transfer through extracellular vesicles (EVs) to act in conjunction with proteins, leading to changes in mRNA, which can provide early signals to indicate forthcoming neuropathological changes in the brain. The aim of this work is to compare expression profiles (obtained by miRNA-seq) from different tissues to highlight commonly expressed and tissue-specific miRNAs. miRNA species from plasma EVs were correlated with miRNA profiles obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Each tissue from ALS patients was compared to controls, revealing 159 deregulated (DE) miRNAs in Exosomes (EXOs), 247 DE miRNAs in PBMCs and 162 DE miRNAs in Microvesicles (MVs). Next, data were filtered to include only miRNAs expressed in disease samples (not in healthy subjects), to reduce the number of tissue- and ALS- specific miRNAs (EXO n=22, MV=11, PBMCs n=8). We identified specific miRNAs and pathways related to each tissue. Interestingly, in PBMCs we found mainly neuro-linked pathways, such as neurotransmitters, brain and neuron development, while in EXOs, we found miRNAs implicated in MAPK and ERB signaling. In contrast, the altered pathways in MVs were not specific. This study shows that the composition of small RNA differs significantly between blood cells and its respective EVs fraction. Differentially expressed miRNAs can target definite transcripts in different cellular and molecular fractions. It is evident that, in terms of miRNAs cargo, MVs are not specific to ALS. Therefore, future studies will focus on the interaction between cells and EXOs.",

Accumulated reports in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, have also provided evidence of dysregulated gene expression related to neuropathogenesis. However, obtaining samples from neurodegenerative patients is more challenging than other human diseases due to low accessibility. Also, brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid are composed of multiple cell types, so they are unsuitable for obtaining neural cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Thus, we here report gene expression profiles in primary neuronal cultures exposed to A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity to understand pathological gene expression in neurons. By RNA-sequencing analysis, we compare transcriptomes and find that two groups of genes show similar expression patterns in A\u03b2 toxicity excitotoxicity\u2014they are either up- or down-regulated in both conditions. Genes in the two groups are related to synaptic function and cell signaling, which are well-known biological functions altered in A\u03b2 toxicity and excitotoxicity.

We confirm the reduced circadian transcription factor Bmal1 levels in A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity.

              "summary": "TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. TREM2 is a cell surface receptor on microglia that regulates homeostatic and immunomodulatory functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic debris and the resolution of damage-associated inflammation. It remains unclear how TREM2 may mediate an influence on neurodegenerative disease, particularly in relation to key neuropathological hallmarks such as neuronal loss and proteinopathy.  We used the ME7 prion disease model to assess the role of TREM2 in the progression and pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Prion diseases are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein and provide a highly tractable platform to determine if TREM2 has disease-modifying effects. Trem2-/- and wild type mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions and effects on CNS disease pathogenesis determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy that alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.",

              "summary": "The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans.

However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases.

However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis -expression QTLs (eQTLs).

Here, we used an AAV with potent motor neuron transduction to deliver optimized Atxn2-targeting miRNAs. Atxn2 knockdown was achieved throughout the central nervous system (CNS) at a dose 40x lower than used in other work. In TAR4/4 mice, miAtxn2 treatment increased mean (54%) and median (45%) survival and robustly improved strength-related measures. There was a corresponding reduction of lower motor neuron death as well as reduced inflammatory markers in both motor cortex and spinal cord, and phosphorylated TDP-43 was reduced to wildtype levels. Transcriptome-wide dysregulation in the TAR4/4 model recapitulated ALS-associated gene signatures that were rescued after Atxn2 reduction, identifying therapeutic mechanisms and potential biomarkers for translation. Additionally, in slow progressing hemizygous mice, treatment slowed disease progression and in ALS patient-derived lower motor neurons, our vector transduced >95% of cells at an MOI 4 logs lower than previously reported for AAV and reduced human ATXN2 in a dose-dependent manner.

Next, data were filtered to include only miRNAs expressed in disease samples (not in healthy subjects), to reduce the number of tissue- and ALS- specific miRNAs (EXO n=22, MV=11, PBMCs n=8). We identified specific miRNAs and pathways related to each tissue. Interestingly, in PBMCs we found mainly neuro-linked pathways, such as neurotransmitters, brain and neuron development, while in EXOs, we found miRNAs implicated in MAPK and ERB signaling. In contrast, the altered pathways in MVs were not specific. This study shows that the composition of small RNA differs significantly between blood cells and its respective EVs fraction. Differentially expressed miRNAs can target definite transcripts in different cellular and molecular fractions. It is evident that, in terms of miRNAs cargo, MVs are not specific to ALS.

Thus, we here report gene expression profiles in primary neuronal cultures exposed to A\u03b2 toxicity and glutamate excitotoxicity to understand pathological gene expression in neurons.

            "summary": "TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. TREM2 is a cell surface receptor on microglia that regulates homeostatic and immunomodulatory functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic debris and the resolution of damage-associated inflammation. It remains unclear how TREM2 may mediate an influence on neurodegenerative disease, particularly in relation to key neuropathological hallmarks such as neuronal loss and proteinopathy.  We used the ME7 prion disease model to assess the role of TREM2 in the progression and pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Prion diseases are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein and provide a highly tractable platform to determine if TREM2 has disease-modifying effects. Trem2-/- and wild type mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions and effects on CNS disease pathogenesis determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition.

Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans.

To unveil these complexities in a comprehensive manner, we utilized single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic sequencing (snm3C-seq) to produce extensive datasets comprising 132,551 methylomes and 72,666 chromatin conformation-methylome joint profiles from eight distinct brain regions of C57BL/6J mice aged 2, 9, and 18 months. These regions include the anterior hippocampus (AHC), posterior hippocampus (PHC), frontal cortex (FC), amygdala (AMY), nucleus accumbens (NACB), PAG/PCG, entorhinal cortex (ENT), and caudate putamen (CP). We utilized this dataset to investigate age-related changes in DNA methylomes and transcription factor motifs potentially affected by methylation alterations. We also examined methylation changes in transposable elements, observing locus-specific retrotransposon activation. At the chromatin conformation level, we analyzed aging-related changes in compartmentalization, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops.

            "geo_summary": "Aging is the primary risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, primarily attributed to progressive changes in cellular epigenomes. Despite this known association, the complexity of the mammalian brain complicates the identification of brain regions and cell types that are most susceptible to aging effects. While alterations in gene expression have been observed in aging neural cells, comprehension of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the transcriptomic changes remains largely elusive.  To unveil these complexities in a comprehensive manner, we utilized single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic sequencing (snm3C-seq) to produce extensive datasets comprising 132,551 methylomes and 72,666 chromatin conformation-methylome joint profiles from eight distinct brain regions of C57BL/6J mice aged 2, 9, and 18 months. These regions include the anterior hippocampus (AHC), posterior hippocampus (PHC), frontal cortex (FC), amygdala (AMY), nucleus accumbens (NACB), PAG/PCG, entorhinal cortex (ENT), and caudate putamen (CP). We utilized this dataset to investigate age-related changes in DNA methylomes and transcription factor motifs potentially affected by methylation alterations. We also examined methylation changes in transposable elements, observing locus-specific retrotransposon activation. At the chromatin conformation level, we analyzed aging-related changes in compartmentalization, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops. Furthermore, we explored regional heterogeneity during aging within identical cell types and validated our findings using the MERFISH dataset.",

            "summary": "In the context of neurodegeneration, activated microglia facilitate inflammation via secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q. Astrocytes exposed to this signaling array polarize to a reactive inflammatory phenotype, termed A1 or A1-like. Astrocytes are essential for neuronal survival, synaptic support, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, but A1-like astrocytes upregulate inflammatory gene expression, downregulate neurotrophic factors, and secrete neurotoxic signals. The consequences of A1-like polarization on BBB function are unknown but may have etiological implications for some diseases. Frequently identified by upregulation of complement component 3 (C3), A1-like astrocytes have been characterized in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with polarization correlated with disease progression and severity. However, the role of A1-like astrocytes in neurodegeneration associated with chronic viral infections, like HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), remains unclear. An in vitro system using primary human astrocytes, as well as a BBB model featuring primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) co-cultured with astrocytes, was used to elucidate cellular and molecular consequences of chronic astrocyte activation. As measured by whole transcriptome analysis and protein expression assays, repeated treatment with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q induced A1-like polarization of astrocytes both in monoculture and in a BBB model, resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory signals. No substantial change to BBB permeability was observed. In contrast, exposure to HIV-1 viral protein Tat did not independently induce A1-like polarization. Ongoing investigations into the effect of astrocyte polarization on BBB integrity and treatment with pathogenic proteins may provide insights into the role of neurotoxic astrocytes in neuroviral pathologies.",

Transcriptome-wide dysregulation in the TAR4/4 model recapitulated ALS-associated gene signatures that were rescued after Atxn2 reduction, identifying therapeutic mechanisms and potential biomarkers for translation.

The aim of this work is to compare expression profiles (obtained by miRNA-seq) from different tissues to highlight commonly expressed and tissue-specific miRNAs. miRNA species from plasma EVs were correlated with miRNA profiles obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Each tissue from ALS patients was compared to controls, revealing 159 deregulated (DE) miRNAs in Exosomes (EXOs), 247 DE miRNAs in PBMCs and 162 DE miRNAs in Microvesicles (MVs). Next, data were filtered to include only miRNAs expressed in disease samples (not in healthy subjects), to reduce the number of tissue- and ALS- specific miRNAs (EXO n=22, MV=11, PBMCs n=8). We identified specific miRNAs and pathways related to each tissue. Interestingly, in PBMCs we found mainly neuro-linked pathways, such as neurotransmitters, brain and neuron development, while in EXOs, we found miRNAs implicated in MAPK and ERB signaling. In contrast, the altered pathways in MVs were not specific. This study shows that the composition of small RNA differs significantly between blood cells and its respective EVs fraction. Differentially expressed miRNAs can target definite transcripts in different cellular and molecular fractions. It is evident that, in terms of miRNAs cargo, MVs are not specific to ALS.

              "summary": "TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. TREM2 is a cell surface receptor on microglia that regulates homeostatic and immunomodulatory functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic debris and the resolution of damage-associated inflammation. It remains unclear how TREM2 may mediate an influence on neurodegenerative disease, particularly in relation to key neuropathological hallmarks such as neuronal loss and proteinopathy.  We used the ME7 prion disease model to assess the role of TREM2 in the progression and pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Prion diseases are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein and provide a highly tractable platform to determine if TREM2 has disease-modifying effects. Trem2-/- and wild type mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions and effects on CNS disease pathogenesis determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy that alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.",

Trem2-/- and wild type mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions and effects on CNS disease pathogenesis determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy that alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.",

              "summary": "The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.",

In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans.

Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of the neuropathology was increased in Trem2-/- mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. The expression of genes involved in myelination were reduced in prion-infected Trem2-/- mice compared to infected WT mice. We conclude that during infection of the brain with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes that are associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy that alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.",

        "title": "Parallel gene expression changes in ventral midbrain dopamine and GABA neurons during normal aging",
        "summary": "The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.",

        "summary": "Aging is the primary risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, primarily attributed to progressive changes in cellular epigenomes. Despite this known association, the complexity of the mammalian brain complicates the identification of brain regions and cell types that are most susceptible to aging effects. While alterations in gene expression have been observed in aging neural cells, comprehension of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the transcriptomic changes remains largely elusive.  To unveil these complexities in a comprehensive manner, we utilized single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic sequencing (snm3C-seq) to produce extensive datasets comprising 132,551 methylomes and 72,666 chromatin conformation-methylome joint profiles from eight distinct brain regions of C57BL/6J mice aged 2, 9, and 18 months. These regions include the anterior hippocampus (AHC), posterior hippocampus (PHC), frontal cortex (FC), amygdala (AMY), nucleus accumbens (NACB), PAG/PCG, entorhinal cortex (ENT), and caudate putamen (CP). We utilized this dataset to investigate age-related changes in DNA methylomes and transcription factor motifs potentially affected by methylation alterations. We also examined methylation changes in transposable elements, observing locus-specific retrotransposon activation. At the chromatin conformation level, we analyzed aging-related changes in compartmentalization, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops. Furthermore, we explored regional heterogeneity during aging within identical cell types and validated our findings using the MERFISH dataset.",
