        "summary": "Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease, both at the pathological and molecular level, and several chromatin-associated proteins play crucial roles in breast cancer initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrate the role of PSIP1 (PC4 and SF2 interacting protein)/p75 (LEDGF) in breast cancer progression. PSIP1/p75, previously identified as a chromatin-adaptor protein, is found to be upregulated in basal-like/triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemistry in tissue arrays showed elevated levels of PSIP1 in metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma. Survival data analyses indicated that the levels of PSIP1 showed a negative association with TNBC patient survival. Depletion of PSIP1/p75 significantly reduced the tumorigenicity and metastatic properties of TNBC cell lines while its over-expression promoted tumorigenicity. Further, gene expression studies revealed that PSIP1 regulates the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion. Finally, by interacting with RNA polymerase II, PSIP1/p75 facilitates the association of RNA pol II to the promoter of cell cycle genes and thereby regulates their transcription. Our findings demonstrate an important role of PSIP1/p75 in TNBC tumorigenicity by promoting the expression of genes that control the cell cycle and tumor metastasis.",

        "summary": "Prognostication of Breast Cancer (BC) relies largely on traditional markers such as hormone or growth factors but due to their suboptimal specificities, it is challenging to identify the subset of patients who are likely to undergo recurrence and markers of higher specificity are sought to guide therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and have shown promise as potential prognostic markers in several cancer types including BC. In our study, we sequenced 104 breast tumor tissue samples and 11 apparently healthy normal breast tissues for miRNAs. Two widely used approaches were adopted to identify prognostic markers \u2013 Case-control and Case-only. For both the approaches, Cox-proportional hazards regression model and risk score analysis was performed to identify miRNA signature independent of potential confounders. Representative miRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR. Gene ontology terms were identified for miRNAs significant in survival analysis. A total of 1,423 miRNAs were captured from the tissues, of which 126 were retained with predetermined criteria for good read counts. In the case-control approach, 80 miRNAs were differentially expressed, from which four and two miRNAs were significant for OS and RFS respectively. In the case-only approach, from 147 miRNAs, 11 and four miRNAs were significant for OS and RFS respectively, in which miR-574-3p and miR-660-5p were novel and were not previously found to be associated with BC prognosis.  Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the risk scores calculated in both the approaches were potential independent prognostic factors for BC. Targets for the identified miRNAs were enriched for cell proliferation, invasion and migration.",

        "summary": "A variety of high-throughput techniques are now available for constructing comprehensive gene regulatory networks in systems biology. In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers. AVAILABILITY: the implementation of CID in R codes can be freely downloaded from (http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~lyliu/BC/).",

        "summary": "Breast cancer (BC) adjuvant therapy after mastectomy in the setting of 1-3 positive lymph nodes has been controversial. This retrospective Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium study evaluated molecular aberrations in primary cancers associated with locoregional recurrence (LRR) or distant metastasis (DM) compared to non-recurrent controls.  We identified 115 HER2 negative, therapy na\u00efve, T 1-3 and N 0-1 BC patients treated with mastectomy but no post-mastectomy radiotherapy.  This included 32 LRR, 34 DM and 49 controls. RNAseq was performed on primary tumors in 110 patients; with no difference in RNA profiles between patients with LRR, DM or controls.  DNA analysis on 57 primary tumors (17 LRR, 15 DM and 25 controls) identified significantly more NF1 mutations and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway gene mutations in patients with LRR (24%, 47%) and DM (27%, 40%) compared to controls (0%, 0%; p<0.0001 and p=0.0070, respectively).  Three patients had matched primary vs LRR samples, one patient had a gain of a NF1 mutation in the LRR.  There was no significant difference between the groups for PTEN loss or cleaved caspase 3 expression.  The mean percentage Ki 67 labeling index was higher in patients with LRR (29.2%) and DM (26%) versus controls (14%,p= 0.0045).  In summary, mutations in the MAPK pathway, specifically NF1, were associated with both LRR and DM, suggesting that alterations in MAPK signaling are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype.  Validation of these associations in tissues from randomized trials may support targeted therapy to reduce breast cancer recurrence.",
        "overall_design": "This is a multicenter retrospective study of patients who underwent mastectomy at a participating Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) institution.  Study centers included Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Duke University, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Georgetown University, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Vanderbilt University, University of Alabama at Birmingham and MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Eligible patients included those patients who underwent mastectomy without radiation for T stage 1-3 and N stage 0-1 breast cancer, and for whom archived tissues and outcome data were available. Patients with any recurrence, loco-regional (LRR) or with distant metastasis (DM), were treated from 1997 to present time as this was felt to represent an era when treatment recommendations would be the most uniform and consistent. Patients with LRR could have a subsequent DM as long as this DM was diagnosed at least 3 months after the LRR. Patients who developed LRR after developing distant metastases were placed in the DM group. Control patients were treated from 1997 to 2007 to allow at least five years follow-up with a disease-free interval.  Controls were matched to cases for age, ER/PR status, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy regimens and year of diagnosis.  All patients were treated with an upfront mastectomy followed by systemic therapy if indicated, which included chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or both.  Patients were ineligible if they received post-mastectomy radiation therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, had a T4 primary tumor, N2 nodal disease, were HER2 positive, had positive margins after mastectomy, had fewer than 10 lymph nodes retrieved at axillary lymph node dissection, or had inadequate follow-up (<5 years) if a control patient.  If specimens were available from the recurrent tumors, these were also collected for exploratory analysis.",

When a cell type was provided by more than one lab, the data for the cells from only one lab are displayed in the table above. However, the data for every cell type from every lab is available from the Downloads page. RRBS was carried out by the Myers production group at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology.",

    "summary": "Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease, both at the pathological and molecular level, and several chromatin-associated proteins play crucial roles in breast cancer initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrate the role of PSIP1 (PC4 and SF2 interacting protein)/p75 (LEDGF) in breast cancer progression. PSIP1/p75, previously identified as a chromatin-adaptor protein, is found to be upregulated in basal-like/triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemistry in tissue arrays showed elevated levels of PSIP1 in metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma. Survival data analyses indicated that the levels of PSIP1 showed a negative association with TNBC patient survival. Depletion of PSIP1/p75 significantly reduced the tumorigenicity and metastatic properties of TNBC cell lines while its over-expression promoted tumorigenicity. Further, gene expression studies revealed that PSIP1 regulates the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion. Finally, by interacting with RNA polymerase II, PSIP1/p75 facilitates the association of RNA pol II to the promoter of cell cycle genes and thereby regulates their transcription. Our findings demonstrate an important role of PSIP1/p75 in TNBC tumorigenicity by promoting the expression of genes that control the cell cycle and tumor metastasis.",

    "title": "Statistical identification of gene association by CID in application of constructing ER regulatory network",
    "summary": "A variety of high-throughput techniques are now available for constructing comprehensive gene regulatory networks in systems biology. In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers.

PSIP1/p75, previously identified as a chromatin-adaptor protein, is found to be upregulated in basal-like/triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemistry in tissue arrays showed elevated levels of PSIP1 in metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma. Survival data analyses indicated that the levels of PSIP1 showed a negative association with TNBC patient survival. Depletion of PSIP1/p75 significantly reduced the tumorigenicity and metastatic properties of TNBC cell lines while its over-expression promoted tumorigenicity. Further, gene expression studies revealed that PSIP1 regulates the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion. Finally, by interacting with RNA polymerase II, PSIP1/p75 facilitates the association of RNA pol II to the promoter of cell cycle genes and thereby regulates their transcription.

Here, we demonstrate the role of PSIP1 (PC4 and SF2 interacting protein)/p75 (LEDGF) in breast cancer progression. PSIP1/p75, previously identified as a chromatin-adaptor protein, is found to be upregulated in basal-like/triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemistry in tissue arrays showed elevated levels of PSIP1 in metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma. Survival data analyses indicated that the levels of PSIP1 showed a negative association with TNBC patient survival. Depletion of PSIP1/p75 significantly reduced the tumorigenicity and metastatic properties of TNBC cell lines while its over-expression promoted tumorigenicity. Further, gene expression studies revealed that PSIP1 regulates the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion. Finally, by interacting with RNA polymerase II, PSIP1/p75 facilitates the association of RNA pol II to the promoter of cell cycle genes and thereby regulates their transcription. Our findings demonstrate an important role of PSIP1/p75 in TNBC tumorigenicity by promoting the expression of genes that control the cell cycle and tumor metastasis.",

A total of 1,423 miRNAs were captured from the tissues, of which 126 were retained with predetermined criteria for good read counts.

        "title": "Statistical identification of gene association by CID in application of constructing ER regulatory network",
        "summary": "A variety of high-throughput techniques are now available for constructing comprehensive gene regulatory networks in systems biology. In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers.

        "summary": "Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease, both at the pathological and molecular level, and several chromatin-associated proteins play crucial roles in breast cancer initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrate the role of PSIP1 (PC4 and SF2 interacting protein)/p75 (LEDGF) in breast cancer progression. PSIP1/p75, previously identified as a chromatin-adaptor protein, is found to be upregulated in basal-like/triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemistry in tissue arrays showed elevated levels of PSIP1 in metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma. Survival data analyses indicated that the levels of PSIP1 showed a negative association with TNBC patient survival. Depletion of PSIP1/p75 significantly reduced the tumorigenicity and metastatic properties of TNBC cell lines while its over-expression promoted tumorigenicity. Further, gene expression studies revealed that PSIP1 regulates the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion. Finally, by interacting with RNA polymerase II, PSIP1/p75 facilitates the association of RNA pol II to the promoter of cell cycle genes and thereby regulates their transcription. Our findings demonstrate an important role of PSIP1/p75 in TNBC tumorigenicity by promoting the expression of genes that control the cell cycle and tumor metastasis.",

        "summary": "A variety of high-throughput techniques are now available for constructing comprehensive gene regulatory networks in systems biology. In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers.

DNA analysis on 57 primary tumors (17 LRR, 15 DM and 25 controls) identified significantly more NF1 mutations and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway gene mutations in patients with LRR (24%, 47%) and DM (27%, 40%) compared to controls (0%, 0%; p<0.0001 and p=0.0070, respectively).

The mean percentage Ki 67 labeling index was higher in patients with LRR (29.2%) and DM (26%) versus controls (14%,p= 0.0045).  In summary, mutations in the MAPK pathway, specifically NF1, were associated with both LRR and DM, suggesting that alterations in MAPK signaling are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype.

In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers.

      "summary": "Breast cancer (BC) adjuvant therapy after mastectomy in the setting of 1-3 positive lymph nodes has been controversial. This retrospective Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium study evaluated molecular aberrations in primary cancers associated with locoregional recurrence (LRR) or distant metastasis (DM) compared to non-recurrent controls.  We identified 115 HER2 negative, therapy na\u00efve, T 1-3 and N 0-1 BC patients treated with mastectomy but no post-mastectomy radiotherapy.  This included 32 LRR, 34 DM and 49 controls. RNAseq was performed on primary tumors in 110 patients; with no difference in RNA profiles between patients with LRR, DM or controls.  DNA analysis on 57 primary tumors (17 LRR, 15 DM and 25 controls) identified significantly more NF1 mutations and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway gene mutations in patients with LRR (24%, 47%) and DM (27%, 40%) compared to controls (0%, 0%; p<0.0001 and p=0.0070, respectively).  Three patients had matched primary vs LRR samples, one patient had a gain of a NF1 mutation in the LRR.  There was no significant difference between the groups for PTEN loss or cleaved caspase 3 expression.  The mean percentage Ki 67 labeling index was higher in patients with LRR (29.2%) and DM (26%) versus controls (14%,p= 0.0045).  In summary, mutations in the MAPK pathway, specifically NF1, were associated with both LRR and DM, suggesting that alterations in MAPK signaling are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype.  Validation of these associations in tissues from randomized trials may support targeted therapy to reduce breast cancer recurrence.",
