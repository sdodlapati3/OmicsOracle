              "summary": "SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 has been spreading all over the world since 2020. Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study. RT-qPCR experiment was performed to validate the DE RNAs, which showed a high consistency with RNA-seq data. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the novel functions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in lung Calu-3 cells, which will be helpful to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of drugs and vaccines in future.",

Here, we report results from a study in which K18-hACE2 mice were fed an obesity-inducing western diet (WD) for over 3 months before intranasal infection with SARS-CoV2. After infection, the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice lost more body weight and had more severe lung inflammation than normal chow (NC)-fed mice.  Bulk RNAseq analysis of lungs and adipose tissue revealed that a diverse landscape of various immune cells, inflammatory markers, and pathways are upregulated in obese COVID-19 patients or the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice when compared with their respective control groups. When compared with infected NC-fed mice in the lung, the infected WD-fed mice had upregulation of IL-6, a well-established marker for severe COVID-19. These results indicate that obesity-accelerated severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 mouse model can be used for dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. Furthermore, in the transcriptome analysis of the lung and adipose tissue obtained from deceased COVID-19 patients, we found upregulation of an array of genes and pathways associated with Inflammation. Both the K18-hACE2 mouse model and human COVID-19 patient data support a link between inflammation and an obesity-accelerated COVID-19 disease phenotype.",

              "summary": "Background: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or its earlier stage Acute lung injury (ALI), is a worldwide health concern that jeopardizes human well-being. Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted. This limitation can be attributed, at least in part, to the substantial variations in immunity observed in individuals with this syndrome. Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI. The CXCL, CSF3 and MIF, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways play a vital role in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ALI, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of human single-cell revealed DCs signaling to monocytes and neutrophils in COVID-19-related ARDS is stronger compared to sepsis-associated ARDS. In sepsis-associated ARDS, CD8+ T and Th cells exhibit more prominent signaling to B-cell nucleated DCs. Meanwhile, both MIF and CXCL signaling pathways are specific to sepsis-associated ARDS. Conclusions: This study has identified specific gene signatures and signaling pathways in animal models and human samples that facilitate the interaction between immune cells, which could be targeted therapeutically in ARDS patients of various etiologies.",

              "summary": "Background: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or its earlier stage Acute lung injury (ALI), is a worldwide health concern that jeopardizes human well-being. Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted. This limitation can be attributed, at least in part, to the substantial variations in immunity observed in individuals with this syndrome. Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI. The CXCL, CSF3 and MIF, TGFb signaling pathways play a vital role in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ALI, respectively.

The mice were allowed to acclimated to the environment for 1 week prior to the experiment. The mice were randomly divided into control, pulmonary ALI, and extra-pulmonary ALI group. Pulmonary ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 mg/kg, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27316, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, L9143) dissolved in 50 ml sterile PBS. Additionally, we used intraperitoneal injection of LPS (25 mg/kg) to construct sepsisrelated ARDS, known as extra-pulmonary ALI.",

              "summary": "Acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS and COVID-19 usually involve a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. IGF1R (Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1) maintains lung homeostasis and is implicated in these pulmonary inflammatory diseases. In mice, widespread IGF1R  deficiency was reported to counteract respiratory inflammation and alveolar damage after bleomycin (BLM)-induced ALI. To explore the molecular mechanisms mediated by Igf1r signaling after BLM challenge, we performed RNA-sequencing in lungs of IGF1R-deficient mice after BLM or saline (SAL) instillation. Transcriptomic analysis identified differentially expressed genes between BLM-challenged and SAL-treated control lungs, detecting biological processes and signaling pathways involved in ALI pathobiology. Igf1r depletion in BLM-challenged mice reversed large part of the transcriptional changes triggered by BLM, counteracting the transcriptomic profile of the inflammatory \"cytokine storm\". Data mining also identified changes in the expression of gene clusters with key roles in DNA damage, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, and epigenetics. Exploration of these functional groups, together with validation studies, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuating effect of Igf1r deficiency on ALI. These findings allow a more comprehensive view of IGF1R signaling at the transcriptional level, reinforcing its important role in promoting ALI and postulating it as a global epigenetic regulator in ARDS.",

During RIT, lungs are deflated and exposed to the body temperature in the recipient's chest cavity. Our prior clinical findings demonstrated that prolonged RIT increases the risk of primary graft dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms of rewarming ischemic injury in this context remain unexplored. We aimed to characterize the rewarming ischemia phase during LuTx by measuring organ temperature and comparing transcriptome and metabolome profiles in tissue obtained at the end versus the start of implantation.",

Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study. RT-qPCR experiment was performed to validate the DE RNAs, which showed a high consistency with RNA-seq data. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the novel functions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in lung Calu-3 cells, which will be helpful to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of drugs and vaccines in future.",

We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform.",

Here, we report results from a study in which K18-hACE2 mice were fed an obesity-inducing western diet (WD) for over 3 months before intranasal infection with SARS-CoV2. After infection, the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice lost more body weight and had more severe lung inflammation than normal chow (NC)-fed mice.  Bulk RNAseq analysis of lungs and adipose tissue revealed that a diverse landscape of various immune cells, inflammatory markers, and pathways are upregulated in obese COVID-19 patients or the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice when compared with their respective control groups. When compared with infected NC-fed mice in the lung, the infected WD-fed mice had upregulation of IL-6, a well-established marker for severe COVID-19. These results indicate that obesity-accelerated severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 mouse model can be used for dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis.

          "summary": "Background: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or its earlier stage Acute lung injury (ALI), is a worldwide health concern that jeopardizes human well-being. Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted. This limitation can be attributed, at least in part, to the substantial variations in immunity observed in individuals with this syndrome. Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI. The CXCL, CSF3 and MIF, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways play a vital role in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ALI, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of human single-cell revealed DCs signaling to monocytes and neutrophils in COVID-19-related ARDS is stronger compared to sepsis-associated ARDS. In sepsis-associated ARDS, CD8+ T and Th cells exhibit more prominent signaling to B-cell nucleated DCs. Meanwhile, both MIF and CXCL signaling pathways are specific to sepsis-associated ARDS. Conclusions: This study has identified specific gene signatures and signaling pathways in animal models and human samples that facilitate the interaction between immune cells, which could be targeted therapeutically in ARDS patients of various etiologies.",

Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study. RT-qPCR experiment was performed to validate the DE RNAs, which showed a high consistency with RNA-seq data.

Here, we report results from a study in which K18-hACE2 mice were fed an obesity-inducing western diet (WD) for over 3 months before intranasal infection with SARS-CoV2. After infection, the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice lost more body weight and had more severe lung inflammation than normal chow (NC)-fed mice.  Bulk RNAseq analysis of lungs and adipose tissue revealed that a diverse landscape of various immune cells, inflammatory markers, and pathways are upregulated in obese COVID-19 patients or the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice when compared with their respective control groups. When compared with infected NC-fed mice in the lung, the infected WD-fed mice had upregulation of IL-6, a well-established marker for severe COVID-19. These results indicate that obesity-accelerated severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 mouse model can be used for dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis.

Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted. This limitation can be attributed, at least in part, to the substantial variations in immunity observed in individuals with this syndrome. Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI. The CXCL, CSF3 and MIF, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways play a vital role in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ALI, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of human single-cell revealed DCs signaling to monocytes and neutrophils in COVID-19-related ARDS is stronger compared to sepsis-associated ARDS. In sepsis-associated ARDS, CD8+ T and Th cells exhibit more prominent signaling to B-cell nucleated DCs. Meanwhile, both MIF and CXCL signaling pathways are specific to sepsis-associated ARDS.

IGF1R (Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1) maintains lung homeostasis and is implicated in these pulmonary inflammatory diseases. In mice, widespread IGF1R  deficiency was reported to counteract respiratory inflammation and alveolar damage after bleomycin (BLM)-induced ALI. To explore the molecular mechanisms mediated by Igf1r signaling after BLM challenge, we performed RNA-sequencing in lungs of IGF1R-deficient mice after BLM or saline (SAL) instillation.

Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study.

Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data.

Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI.

Igf1r depletion in BLM-challenged mice reversed large part of the transcriptional changes triggered by BLM, counteracting the transcriptomic profile of the inflammatory \"cytokine storm\". Data mining also identified changes in the expression of gene clusters with key roles in DNA damage, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, and epigenetics. Exploration of these functional groups, together with validation studies, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuating effect of Igf1r deficiency on ALI. These findings allow a more comprehensive view of IGF1R signaling at the transcriptional level, reinforcing its important role in promoting ALI and postulating it as a global epigenetic regulator in ARDS.",

Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study. RT-qPCR experiment was performed to validate the DE RNAs, which showed a high consistency with RNA-seq data.

After infection, the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice lost more body weight and had more severe lung inflammation than normal chow (NC)-fed mice.

Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted.

Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI.

Igf1r depletion in BLM-challenged mice reversed large part of the transcriptional changes triggered by BLM, counteracting the transcriptomic profile of the inflammatory \"cytokine storm\". Data mining also identified changes in the expression of gene clusters with key roles in DNA damage, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, and epigenetics. Exploration of these functional groups, together with validation studies, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuating effect of Igf1r deficiency on ALI. These findings allow a more comprehensive view of IGF1R signaling at the transcriptional level, reinforcing its important role in promoting ALI and postulating it as a global epigenetic regulator in ARDS.",

Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study. RT-qPCR experiment was performed to validate the DE RNAs, which showed a high consistency with RNA-seq data. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the novel functions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in lung Calu-3 cells, which will be helpful to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of drugs and vaccines in future.",

Here, we report results from a study in which K18-hACE2 mice were fed an obesity-inducing western diet (WD) for over 3 months before intranasal infection with SARS-CoV2. After infection, the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice lost more body weight and had more severe lung inflammation than normal chow (NC)-fed mice.  Bulk RNAseq analysis of lungs and adipose tissue revealed that a diverse landscape of various immune cells, inflammatory markers, and pathways are upregulated in obese COVID-19 patients or the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice when compared with their respective control groups. When compared with infected NC-fed mice in the lung, the infected WD-fed mice had upregulation of IL-6, a well-established marker for severe COVID-19. These results indicate that obesity-accelerated severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 mouse model can be used for dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis.

Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted. This limitation can be attributed, at least in part, to the substantial variations in immunity observed in individuals with this syndrome. Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI. The CXCL, CSF3 and MIF, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways play a vital role in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ALI, respectively.

        "title": "Whole transcriptome exploration revealed the dysregulated RNAs involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibited apoptosis in Calu-3 cells",
        "summary": "SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 has been spreading all over the world since 2020. Although the vaccines have been planted and efficiently suppressed the momentum, it is not fully understood how SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, especially for the functions of its spike (S) glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the biological and molecular functions of S protein by infecting the commercial pure S protein into human Calu-3 cells and analyzing apoptotic level change and its regulated transcriptome profile using whole transcriptome sequencing method (RNA-seq). Strikingly, we found S protein alone could significantly inhibit apoptotic level with dose dependent manner in Calu-3 cells, with or without ActD treatment. Higher level of S protein has more effective inhibition on cellular apoptosis. ActD-treated RNA-seq data analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were differentially expressed at post-transcriptional level. Functional enrichment analysis of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs showed they were highly enriched in inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and apoptotic process pathways. Host genes of circRNAs were enriched in metabolic and lysosome pathways. Finally, we constructed an RNA regulatory network involving these three RNA classes that were dysregulated in this study. RT-qPCR experiment was performed to validate the DE RNAs, which showed a high consistency with RNA-seq data. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the novel functions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in lung Calu-3 cells, which will be helpful to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of drugs and vaccines in future.",

        "summary": "Obesity is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. However, the mechanism underlying obesity-accelerated COVID-19 remains unclear. Here, we report results from a study in which K18-hACE2 mice were fed an obesity-inducing western diet (WD) for over 3 months before intranasal infection with SARS-CoV2. After infection, the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice lost more body weight and had more severe lung inflammation than normal chow (NC)-fed mice.  Bulk RNAseq analysis of lungs and adipose tissue revealed that a diverse landscape of various immune cells, inflammatory markers, and pathways are upregulated in obese COVID-19 patients or the WD-fed K18-hACE2 mice when compared with their respective control groups. When compared with infected NC-fed mice in the lung, the infected WD-fed mice had upregulation of IL-6, a well-established marker for severe COVID-19. These results indicate that obesity-accelerated severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 mouse model can be used for dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. Furthermore, in the transcriptome analysis of the lung and adipose tissue obtained from deceased COVID-19 patients, we found upregulation of an array of genes and pathways associated with Inflammation. Both the K18-hACE2 mouse model and human COVID-19 patient data support a link between inflammation and an obesity-accelerated COVID-19 disease phenotype.",

        "title": "Heterogeneity of Immune Cells and Their Communications Unveiled by Transcriptome Profiling in Acute Inflammatory Lung Injury",
        "summary": "Background: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or its earlier stage Acute lung injury (ALI), is a worldwide health concern that jeopardizes human well-being. Currently, the treatment strategies to mitigate the incidence and mortality of ARDS are severely restricted. This limitation can be attributed, at least in part, to the substantial variations in immunity observed in individuals with this syndrome. Methods: Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing from ALI mice and single cell RNA sequencing from ARDS patients were analyzed. We utilized the Seurat program package in R and cellmarker 2.0 to cluster and annotate the data. The differential, enrichment, protein interaction, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted. Results: The mice with ALI caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors demonstrated differential expression including Clec4e, Retnlg, S100a9, Coro1a, and Lars2. We have determined that inflammatory factors have a greater significance in extrapulmonary ALI, while multiple pathways collaborate in the development of pulmonary ALI. Clustering analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the relative abundance of immune cells in different ALI models. The autocrine action of neutrophils plays a crucial role in pulmonary ALI. Additionally, there was a significant increase in signaling intensity between B cells and M1 macrophages, NKT cells and M1 macrophages in extrapulmonary ALI. The CXCL, CSF3 and MIF, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways play a vital role in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ALI, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of human single-cell revealed DCs signaling to monocytes and neutrophils in COVID-19-related ARDS is stronger compared to sepsis-associated ARDS. In sepsis-associated ARDS, CD8+ T and Th cells exhibit more prominent signaling to B-cell nucleated DCs. Meanwhile, both MIF and CXCL signaling pathways are specific to sepsis-associated ARDS. Conclusions: This study has identified specific gene signatures and signaling pathways in animal models and human samples that facilitate the interaction between immune cells, which could be targeted therapeutically in ARDS patients of various etiologies.",
