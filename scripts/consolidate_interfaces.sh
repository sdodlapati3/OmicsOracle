## Legacy Interface Comparison

### Modern Interface
- [WARN] **Limited Features**: Basic search and display functionality
- [WARN] **No Real-time Updates**: Static interface without live data
- [WARN] **Minimal Visualizations**: Basic charts and plots
- [FAIL] **No AI Integration**: Missing intelligent agent capabilities
- [FAIL] **Limited Mobile Support**: Not fully responsive

### Current Interface
- [WARN] **Basic Functionality**: Core search capabilities only
- [FAIL] **No Advanced Features**: Missing modern web capabilities
- [FAIL] **Limited Extensibility**: Monolithic architecture
- [FAIL] **No Performance Monitoring**: Missing operational features

## Migration Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Feature Gap Analysis**: Identify any missing functionality
2. **User Workflow Testing**: Validate all research workflows
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Ensure performance targets are met
4. **Documentation Update**: Update all user guides and references

### Migration Strategy
1. **Soft Launch**: Deploy futuristic interface alongside legacy
2. **User Training**: Provide comprehensive training materials
3. **Gradual Transition**: Phase out legacy interfaces over time
4. **Archive Legacy**: Move old interfaces to archive with clear deprecation

## Conclusion

The **futuristic interface exceeds the functionality** of all legacy interfaces and provides significant architectural and feature improvements. **Recommendation: Proceed with consolidation.**

# Interface Deprecated

This interface has been deprecated in favor of the **futuristic interface**.

## Migration Information

- **New Interface**: \`interfaces/futuristic/\`
- **Migration Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Reason**: Consolidation to reduce maintenance overhead and provide better user experience

## What to do

1. Update any bookmarks or links to use the futuristic interface
2. Review the new interface documentation at \`interfaces/futuristic/README.md\`
3. Contact support if you need assistance with the transition

## Archive Timeline

This interface will be moved to the archive after a 30-day deprecation period.
